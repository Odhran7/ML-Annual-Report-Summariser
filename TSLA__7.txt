in 2021 our net income attributable to common stockholders was 552 billion representing a favorable change of 480 billion compared to the prior year we continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies 

we ended 2021 with 1758 billion in cash and cash equivalents representing a decrease of 181 billion from the end of 2020 our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 was 1150 billion representing an increase of 555 billion compared to 594 billion during 2020 and capital expenditures amounted to 648 billion during 2021 compared to 316 billion during 2020 sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself but we will continue investing in a number of capitalintensive projects in upcoming periods 

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2022 outlook 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

  

beginning in the first quarter of 2021 there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against covid19 as well as an easing of restrictions on social business travel and government activities and functions on the other hand infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic including challenges and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains such as increased port congestion intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor supply we have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments 

  

ultimately we cannot predict the duration of the covid19 pandemic we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly 

  

automotive—production 

the following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development as of the date of this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

we are focused on ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing capacity at our current factories our current production continues to be affected by the industrywide semiconductor and other component shortages requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions to be implemented which may be difficult to sustain builds of model y in gigafactory texas and equipment testing through the vehicle production process in gigafactory berlin started in late 2021 the next phase of production growth will depend on the testing and ramp at gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have highvolume output lower capital and production costs and longer range consistent with our approach of innovating manufacturing techniques at our new factories we expect as well to pioneer new methods related to the mass production of these cells and our unique structural battery pack concept our goals are to improve vehicle performance decrease production costs and increase affordability 

however these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects any industrywide component constraints which may increase the number of manufacturing and production design workaround solutions required labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the covid19 pandemic moreover we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory 

automotive—demand and sales 

our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in china in addition to ramping production in 2022 we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality including through products based on artificial intelligence such as autopilot and fsd and other software features moreover we expect to continue to benefit from a spike in demand in the automotive industry generally as well as ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness 

however we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the covid19 pandemic moreover as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation we will have to continue to execute well to maintain our momentum 

automotive—deliveries and customer infrastructure 

  

as our deliveries increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at gigafactory shanghai has been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the united states and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets as we expand our manufacturing operations globally we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction in particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations 

  

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment 

  

the longterm success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes we continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand including beginning construction of our megafactory in lathrop california but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints for megapack energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones for powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products we remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a lowcost and simplified online ordering experience in addition we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for solar roof by onboarding and training new installers as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs as these product lines grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of solar roof 

cash flow and capital expenditure trends 

our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions we are simultaneously ramping new products in the new model s and model x megapack and solar roof ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects the pace at which we meet milestones production adjustments to and among our various products increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between 500 to 700 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years 

our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation on the other hand we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capitalintensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the covid19 pandemic moreover as our stock price has significantly increased we have seen higher levels of early conversions of “inthemoney” convertible senior notes which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes overall we expect our ability to be selffunding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales 

operating expense trends 

as long as we see expanding sales and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation we expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally 

in the first quarter of 2021 we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin we believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash as with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cashequivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions digital assets are considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules accordingly any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale for any digital assets held now or in the future these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase for example in the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded approximately 101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of 128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected 

  

due to the covid19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets the estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted we have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10k these estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under asc 606 including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle revenue related to fsd features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue 

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts 

automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value 

we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with asc 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values 

  

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff 

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material writedowns may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period 

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

income taxes 

we are subject to taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2021 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

  

  

results of operations 

  

revenues 

  

   

automotive  services and other segment 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new model s model x model 3 and model y vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting 

automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production sales and pricing negotiated with our customers we monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits 

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct salestype leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer 

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue 

2021 compared to 2020 

automotive sales revenue increased 1952 billion or 79 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase of 433815 model 3 and model y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of model y sales offset by regional sales mix additionally we had a 365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees which increased our automotive sales revenue due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 the increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28819 model s and model x cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of model s and model x only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021 respectively 

automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased 115 million or 7 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions 

automotive leasing revenue increased 590 million or 56 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct salestype leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020  these increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined 

services and other revenue increased 150 billion or 65 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue 

energy generation and storage segment 

energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives 

  

2021 compared to 2020 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 795 million or 40 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in deployments of megapack solar cash and loan jobs powerwall and solar roof partially offset by a decrease in powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of megapack  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  

   

automotive  services and other segment 

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs 

cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 

2021 compared to 2020 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 1272 billion or 65 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase of 433815 model 3 and model y cash deliveries additionally the net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulted in a corresponding increase of 286 million in cost of automotive sales revenue these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 28819 model s and model x cash deliveries at higher costs per unit due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes during our current production ramp of the new versions of model s and model x additionally there was a decrease in combined average model 3 and model y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as gigafactory shanghai has ramped in capacity where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in china 

  

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 415 million or 74 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct salestype leasing cost of revenues from more sales in the current year these increases were partially offset by the decrease in cost of automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined 

cost of services and other revenue increased 124 billion or 46 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of nontesla used vehicles costs to support our increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue and costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased 

gross margin for total automotive increased from 256 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 293 in the year ended december 31 2021 the increase was primarily due to favorable changes in sales and production mix of model 3 and model y as gigafactory shanghai has ramped in capacity the average model 3 and model y costs per unit have decreased significantly due to localized procurement and manufacturing in china despite rising raw material commodity logistics and expedite costs additionally our model y gross margin has benefitted from shared manufacturing of model 3 and learnings from the scaling of past products these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 115 million in sales of regulatory credits which have negligible incremental costs associated with them 

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment increased from 224 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 269 in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and an improvement in our services and other gross margin additionally there was a lower proportion of services and other which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business within the segment in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year 

energy generation and storage segment 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand in agreements for solar energy system and ppas where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 

2021 compared to 2020 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 942 million or 48 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to increases in deployments of solar roof solar cash and loan jobs megapack and powerwall partially offset by reductions in average costs per unit of solar roof as deployments have increased and a decrease in powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of megapack 

gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 09 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 46 in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to a higher proportion of solar roof in our overall energy business which operated at a lower gross margin as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp despite an improvement in gross margin compared to the prior year and lower powerpack gross margin as fixed cost absorptions are negatively impacted as we phase out the product following the introduction of megapack these decreases were partially offset by a higher proportion of powerwall in our overall energy business which operated at a higher gross margin as well as an increase in megapack gross margin as we continue to scale the products 

research and development expense 

  

   

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense 

  

rd expenses increased 110 billion or 74 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 506 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to an increase in headcount a 263 million increase in rd expensed materials a 211 million increase in facilities outside services freight and depreciation expense and an 103 million increase in stockbased compensation expense these increases were to support our expanding product roadmap such as the new versions of model s and model x and technologies including our proprietary battery cells and there were additional rd expenses as we were in the preproduction phases at both gigafactory texas and gigafactory berlin in the current year 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 5 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 rd expenses increased proportionately with the increase in total revenues from expanding sales 

selling general and administrative expense 

  

   

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements 

sga expenses increased 137 billion or 44 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase is primarily due to an increase of 568 million in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount and increased payroll taxes due to our higher average share price in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year additionally there was 340 million of additional payroll tax due to our ceos option exercises from the 2012 ceo performance award a 319 million increase in office information technology facilitiesrelated expenses sales and marketing activities and other costs and an increase of 145 million in stockbased compensation expense of which 72 million was attributable to the 2018 ceo performance award see note 13 equity incentive plans  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 10 in the year ended december 31 2020 to 8 in the year ended december 31 2021 our sga expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to operational efficiencies 

restructuring and other expense 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded 101 million of impairment losses on bitcoin we also realized gains of 128 million in connection with selling a portion of our holdings in march 2021 see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 3 digital assets net  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense decreased by 377 million or 50 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to a reduction of 173 million as a result of the adoption of asu 202006 accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity on january 1 2021 whereby we have derecognized the remaining debt discounts on the 2022 notes and 2024 notes and therefore no longer recognize any amortization of debt discounts as interest expense as well as the continued reduction in our overall debt balance see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

  

other income expense net 

  

   

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates 

other income expense net changed favorably by 257 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a 49 million favorable change in the marktomarket remeasurement of our interest rate swaps

our provision for income taxes increased by 407 million or 139 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to the increases in taxable profits within our foreign jurisdictions year over year 

our effective tax rate decreased from 25 to 11 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to growth in pretax income and changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings 

see note 14 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 

  

   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by 16 million or 11 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years the cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory shanghai and gigafactory new york the construction and ramp of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities 

in addition because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment for example if our nearterm manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic or business conditions we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures finally we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds conversely we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early 

accordingly we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12month period following december 31 2021 as well as in the longterm 

  

see the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs 

material cash requirements 

from time to time in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products however due to contractual terms variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps and opportunities to renegotiate pricing we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short term and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project 

as discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—management opportunities challenges and risks and 2022 outlook—cash flow and capital expenditure trends in this annual report on form 10k we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between 500 to 700 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years in connection with our operations at gigafactory new york we have an agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york through december 31 2029 pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in april 2021 and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the suny foundation in august 2021 we also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend rmb 1408 billion in capital expenditures at gigafactory shanghai by the end of 2023 for details regarding these obligations refer to note 15 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2021 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 538 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of which 109 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months as of december 31 2021 our total minimum lease payments are 403 billion of which 104 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months for details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations refer to note 11 debt  and note 12 leases to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

sources and conditions of liquidity 

our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings when applicable 

as of december 31 2021 we had 1758 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 722 billion and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and canadian dollars in addition we had 111 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of december 31 2021 certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets for details regarding our indebtedness refer to note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we continue adapting our investment strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives such as investing in us government and other marketable securities digital assets and providing product related financing in the first quarter of 2021 we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin the fair market value of our bitcoin holdings as of december 31 2021 was 199 billion we believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash as with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cash equivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions however digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices which may be unfavorable at the times when we may want or need to liquidate them additionally we held shortterm marketable securities of 131 million as of december 31 2021 

  

summary of cash flows 

  

   

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 555 billion to 1150 billion during the year ended december 31 2021 from 594 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 this increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 522 billion and the overall decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 334 million the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by larger increases of inventory and operating lease vehicles compared to the prior year 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 648 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 and 316 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 mainly for the construction of gigafactory texas and gigafactory berlin and the expansions of gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory additionally net cash outflows related to digital assets were 123 billion in the year ended december 31 2021 from purchases of digital assets for 150 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of 272 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash outflows from financing activities were 520 billion during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 997 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 the change was primarily due to no equity offerings in 2021 compared to 1227 billion of proceeds from issuances of common stock net of issuance costs in 2020 a 337 billion increase in net repayments of convertible and other debt compared to the prior year offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances of 290 million and a decrease in collateralized lease repayments of 231 million compared to the prior year see note 11 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our debt obligations

 item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2018related items refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2019 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 13 2020

overview and 2020 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation financial and other services related to our products

in 2020 we produced 509737 vehicles and delivered 499647 vehicles we are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity developing and ramping our battery cell technology increasing the affordability of our vehicles expanding our global infrastructure and introducing our next vehicles

in 2020 we deployed 302 gwh of energy storage products and 205 megawatts of solar energy systems we are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products improving our solar roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems

in 2020 we recognized total revenues of 3154 billion representing an increase of 696 billion compared to the prior year we continue to ramp production build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth

in 2020 our net income attributable to common stockholders was 721 million representing a favorable change of 158 billion compared to the prior year in 2020 our operating margin was 63 representing a favorable change of 66 compared to the prior year we continue to focus on operational efficiencies while we have seen an acceleration of noncash stockbased compensation expense due to a rapid increase in our market capitalization and updates to our business outlook

we ended 2020 with 1938 billion in cash and cash equivalents representing an increase of 1312 billion from the end of 2019 our cash flows from operating activities during 2020 was 594 billion compared to 241 billion during 2019 and capital expenditures amounted to 316 billion during 2020 compared to 133 billion during 2019 sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself but we will continue a number of capitalintensive projects in upcoming periods

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2021 outlook

impact of covid19 pandemic

 

there continues to be worldwide impact from the covid19 pandemic while we have been relatively successful in navigating such impact to date we have previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments there are also ongoing related risks to our business depending on the progression of the pandemic and recent trends in certain regions have indicated potential returns to limited or closed government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries for example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted please see the “results of operations” section of this item below and certain risk factors described in part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k particularly the first risk factor included there for more detailed descriptions of the impact and risks to our business 

we cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends from this pandemic the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and has varied across geographic regions ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly

 

automotive—production 

the following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development as of the date of this annual report on form 10k

 



 

we recently announced updated versions of model s and model x featuring a redesigned powertrain and other improvements in 2021 we are focused on ramping these models on new manufacturing equipment as well as production rates of model 3 and model y to at least the capacity that we have installed the next phase of production growth will depend on the construction of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas each of which is progressing as planned for deliveries beginning in 2021 our goal is to continuously decrease production costs and increase the affordability of our vehicles we are continuing to develop and manufacture our own battery cells with which we are targeting highvolume output lower capital and production costs and longer range as cell supply is critical to our business coupling this strategy with cells from our suppliers will help us stay ahead of any potential constraints 

however these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the covid19 pandemic and any industrywide component constraints moreover we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory 

automotive—demand and sales

our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in china in addition to opening new factories in 2021 we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ functionality including autopilot fsd and software features and introducing anticipated future vehicles moreover we expect to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness

however we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the covid19 pandemic on the other hand there have been recent signs of recovery from competitors that experienced downturns in 2020 meaning that we will have to continue to execute well to maintain the momentum that we have gained relative to an evergrowing competitive landscape

automotive—deliveries and customer infrastructure

 

as our deliveries increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries situating our factories closer to local markets should mitigate the strain on our deliveries in any case as we expand we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger locations to ensure costeffectiveness and customer satisfaction in particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations 

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

 

the longterm success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes we continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand for powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher interest and crossselling with our residential solar energy products will continue to benefit both product lines we remain committed to increasing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a lowcost and simplified online ordering experience in addition we are working to improve our installation capabilities for solar roof by onboarding and training a large number of installers and reducing the installation time dramatically as these product lines grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of solar roof

 

cash flow and capital expenditure trends 

our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time and uncertainties in future global market conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic currently makes projections more challenging we are simultaneously ramping new products in the new model s and model x model y and solar roof constructing or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects the pace at which we meet milestones production adjustments to and among our various products increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditures to be 450 to 600 billion in 2021 and each of the next two fiscal years

our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation on the other hand we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capitalintensive projects moreover as our stock price has significantly increased recently we have seen higher levels of early conversions of “inthemoney” convertible senior notes which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes overall we expect our ability to be selffunding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales we also opportunistically strengthened our liquidity further through an atthemarket offering of common stock in december 2020 with net proceeds to us of approximately 499 billion 

operating expense trends 

as long as we see expanding sales and excluding the potential impact of noncash stock compensation expense attributable to the 2018 ceo performance award and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we additionally increase operational efficiency and process automation

in march 2018 our stockholders approved a performancebased stock option award to our ceo the “2018 ceo performance award” consisting of 12 vesting tranches contingent on the achievement of specified market capitalization and operational milestones we incur noncash stockbased compensation expense for each tranche only after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance and if this happens following the grant date we record at such time a cumulative catchup expense that may be significant based on the length of time elapsed from the grant date moreover the remaining expense for that tranche is ratably recorded over the period remaining until the later of i the expected achievement of the relevant operational milestone if it has not yet been achieved and ii the expected achievement of the related market capitalization milestone if it has not yet been achieved upon vesting of a tranche all remaining associated expense is recognized immediately because the expected market capitalization achievements are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievements the achievement of the former earlier than expected may increase the magnitude of any catchup expense andor accelerate the rate at which the remaining expense is recognized during 2020 several operational milestones became probable and several tranches vested including as a result of our market capitalization increasing rapidly resulting in the recognition or acceleration of related expense earlier than anticipated and within a relatively short period of time see note 14 equity incentive plans —2018 ceo performance award to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding the stockbased compensation relating to the 2018 ceo performance award as our market capitalization is unpredictable and our financial performance improves it is possible that the earlierthanplanned recognition of such expenses will continue in the near term

in january 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity as part of the policy we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt digital assets are considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules accordingly any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale as we currently intend to hold these assets longterm these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected

due to the covid19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets the estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted we have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this annual report on form 10k t hese estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition

automotive segment

automotive sales revenue 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under asc 606 including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle revenue related to fsd features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value

 

with the exception of the vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option program discussed within the automotive leasing section below  we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with asc 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception  the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns as we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values 

automotive regulatory credits 

we earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to zevs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel we sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations

automotive leasing revenue 

direct vehicle operating leasing program 

we have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the us canada and in certain countries in europe qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for model s and model x leases in certain regions may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases we record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option 

we offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the us and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases these transactions entailed a transfer of leases which we had originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner as control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with asc 606 these transactions were accounted for as interestbearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with asc 840 leases  prior to january 1 2019 under this program cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under asc 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term consequently any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue the end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

 

direct sales t ype leasing program 

we have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as salestype leases under asc 842 in certain countries in asia and europe which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020 depending on the specific program customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term if the customer does not have a right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments under the programs for which there is a right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months we recognize all revenue and costs associated with the salestype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue respectively upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage sales 

energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers including solar subscriptionbased arrangements energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and ppas that commence after january 1 2019 which is recognized as earned based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for ppas at the contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met under the practical expedient available under asc 606105518 we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business

for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance

in instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems as our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred

 

as part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract in certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur 

we record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term 

energy generation and storage leasing 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas prior to january 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 

we capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and ppas which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations

stockbased compensation

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized if additional operational milestones become probable stockbased compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catchup expense for the service provided since the grant date the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations

income taxes

we are subject to taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2020 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is likely that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties the third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets for certain funds there may be significant fluctuations in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as timebased milestones are reached

 

 

results of operations 

effects of covid19

the covid19 pandemic impacted our business and financial results in 2020

the temporary suspension of production at our factories during the first half of 2020 caused production limitations that together with reduced or closed government and third party partner operations in the year negatively impacted our deliveries and deployments in 2020 while we resumed operations at all of our factories worldwide our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation certain payroll related expenses and property taxes as part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while they were scaled back in the first half of 2020 this included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions additionally we suspended noncritical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements as part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial results such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses the impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits

 

revenues

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new model s model x model 3 and model y vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity fsd features and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting our revenue from regulatory credits fluctuates depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer and when the credits are delivered

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting we began offering direct leasing for model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019 and we began offering direct leasing for model y vehicles in the third quarter of 2020 additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct salestype leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue

 

2020 compared to 2019 

automotive sales revenue increased 623 billion or 31 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to an increase of 129268 model 3 and model y cash deliveries despite production limitations as a result of temporary suspension of production at the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada during the first half of 2020 we were able to increase deliveries year over year from production ramping at both gigafactory shanghai and the fremont factory there was also an increase of 986 million from additional sales of regulatory credits to 158 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 additionally due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended december 31 2019 we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales revenue of 555 million we made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of automotive sales revenue of 72 million during the year ended december 31 2020 the smaller reduction in revenue from pricing adjustments resulted in a positive impact to automotive sales revenue of 483 million year over year these factors increasing automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in the combined average selling price of model 3 and model y despite the inclusion of higher priced model y deliveries in 2020 the combined average selling price of model 3 and model y decreased due to a higher proportion of model 3 standard range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year additionally there was a decrease in automotive sales revenue from 8669 fewer model s and model x cash deliveries at a relatively consistent combined average selling price in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year 

automotive leasing revenue increased 183 million or 21 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct salestype leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer these increases were partially offset by the decreases in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined 

services and other revenue increased 80 million or 4 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow an increase in retail merchandise revenue and an increase in sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers as we had a partial year of sales in the prior year from our midyear 2019 acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in used vehicle revenue driven by a reduction in nontesla tradeins 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives

2020 compared to 2019 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 463 million or 30 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to increases in deployments of megapack solar cash and loan jobs and powerwall partially offset by a decrease in deployments of powerpack and reduced average selling prices on our solar cash and loan jobs as a result of our low cost solar strategy powerpack deployments have decreased following the introduction of our megapack product which we began deploying in late 2019

 

cost of revenues and gross margin 

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases which were introduced in volume in the third quarter of 2020 as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs

cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services costs to acquire and certify used vehicles costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

2020 compared to 2019 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 376 billion or 24 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an increase of 129268 model 3 and model y cash deliveries due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended december 31 2019 we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and if customers elect to exercise the buyback option we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles which resulted in a reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of 451 million we made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of 42 million during the year ended december 31 2020 additionally there was an increase to cost of automotive sales revenue from idle capacity charges of 213 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada during the first half of 2020 these factors increasing cost of automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in average model 3 costs per unit due to lower material manufacturing freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in china and a higher sales mix of lower end trims as well as a decrease of 8669 model s and model x cash deliveries in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year 

 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 104   million  or 23  in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct salestype leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all cost of revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer these increases were partially offset by the decreases in cost of automotive lease revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined  

cost of services and other revenue decreased 99 million or 4 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to a decrease in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by a reduction in nontesla tradeins partially offset by increases in nonwarranty maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow and an increase in costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased 

gross margin for total automotive increased from 21 to 26 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to an improvement of model 3 gross margin primarily from lower material manufacturing freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in china partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of model 3 due to a higher proportion of model 3 standard range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year additionally there was an increase of 986 million in sales of regulatory credits and a positive impact from model y deliveries in 2020 as model y gross margin was higher than our prior year total automotive gross margin these increases were partially offset by idle capacity charges of 213 million as a result of a temporary suspension of production at the fremont factory and gigafactory nevada during the first half of 2020 

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment increased from 17 to 22 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a lower proportion of services and other which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business within the segment in the year ended december 31 2020 additionally there was an improvement in our nonwarranty maintenance services gross margin due to increased operational efficiencies despite additional costs from ramping service centers to accommodate a larger deployed fleet and an improvement in our used vehicle sales gross margin 

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand in agreements for solar energy system and ppas where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs

2020 compared to 2019 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 635 million or 47 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to increases in deployments of megapack higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar roof ramp increases in deployments of powerwall and idle capacity charges of 20 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at gigafactory new york during the first half of 2020 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in deployments of powerpack 

gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 12 to 1 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to a higher proportion of solar roof in our overall energy business which operated at lower gross margins as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp additionally there were lower gross margins in our solar cash and loan business from reduced average selling prices as a result of our low cost solar strategy partially offset by lower materials and manufacturing costs 

research and development expense

 



 

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense

 

rd expenses increased 148   million  or 11  in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  the increase was primarily due to a 62 million increase in expensed materials as we continue to expand our product roadmap  61 million increase in stockbased compensation expense primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price 20 million increase in facilities freight and depreciation expenses and a 20 million increase in employee and labor related expenses 

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 55 to 47 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease is primarily an increase in total revenues from expanding sales partially offset by an increase in our rd expenses as detailed above 

selling general and administrative expense

 



 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements

sga expenses increased 499 million or 19 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase is primarily due to an increase of 625 million in stockbased compensation expense of which 542 million was attributable to the 2018 ceo performance award we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 838 million in the year ended december 31 2020 for the 2018 ceo performance award compared to 296 million in the prior year of the expense recorded in fiscal year 2020 232 million was due to cumulative catchup expense for the service provided from the grant date when three operational milestones under such award were considered probable of being met and the remaining unamortized expense of 357 million for the first four tranches were recognized upon vesting as the first four market capitalization milestones were achieved see note 14 equity incentive plans  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the remaining stockbased compensation expense increase of 83 million attributable to other directors and employees is primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price the increase in stockbased compensation was partially offset by a decrease of 90 million in customer promotional costs facilitiesrelated expenses and sales and marketing activities additionally there was a reduction to operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the amount of 43 million for the settlement in part of the securities litigation relating to the solarcity acquisition see note 16 commitments and contingencies—legal proceedings—securities litigation relating to the solarcity acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11 to 10 in year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease is primarily from an increase in total revenues from expanding sales partially offset by an increase in our sga expenses as detailed above 

restructuring and other

 



 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency there were no restructuring actions in the year ended december 31 2020

interest expense

 



 

 

interest expense increased by 63   million  or 9  in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019  primarily due to 105 million of losses on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year 2020 from early conversions on our convertible senior notes  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate as compared to the prior year and an increase of 17 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statements of operations to property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets increased capitalization results in lower interest expense the amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance which increased yearoveryear due to our construction and expansion of multiple factories 

other income expense net

 



 

other expense income net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates

other expense income net changed unfavorably by 167 million in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the unfavorable change was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the us dollar depreciating greater than 5 against the euro and the chinese yuan in 2020 compared to an appreciation of 2 and 1 against the same currencies in the prior year respectively 

provision for income taxes

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 182 million or 165 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily due to the substantial increases in taxable profits in our foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear 

our effective tax rate increased from 17 to 25 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to substantial pretax income in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to a pretax loss for the year ended december 31 2019

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 



 

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests increased by 54 million or 62 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily due to lower activities from new financing fund arrangements 

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2020 we had 1938 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 676 billion and consisted primarily of euros chinese yuan and canadian dollars our sources of cash are 

 

predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings 

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products and technologies including our announced proprietary battery cells ongoing production and additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the fremont factory gigafactory nevada gigafactory shanghai and gigafactory new york the construction of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities 

as discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—management opportunities challenges and risks and 2021 outlook—cash flow and capital expenditure trends in this annual report on form 10k we currently expect our capital expenditures to be 450 to 600 billion in 2021 and in each of the next two fiscal years 

we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources for example our local subsidiary has entered into credit facilities to support construction and production at gigafactory shanghai see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k as always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business 

in january 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity as part of the policy we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt we believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid however digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them 

we have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period beginning april 30 2018 which we expect to meet through our operations as we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at gigafactory new york pursuant to a new york state executive order issued in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant as of april 30 2020 with our applicable targets under such agreement

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months even considering the expected levels of capital expenditures in the current and next two fiscal years a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network for example if our nearterm manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic conditions and levels of consumer outlook and spend impacting demand in the worldwide transportation automotive and energy product industries we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

in addition we had 263 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of december 31 2020 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds  refer to note 12 debt  and note 17 variable interest entity arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

summary of cash flows

 



 

 

cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 354 billion to 594 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 from 240 billion during the year ended december 31 2019 this increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 282 billion the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 533 million and 188 million of the repayment of our 025 convertible senior notes due in 2019 during the three months ended march 31 2019 which represents the portion of the repayment that was classified as an operating activity as this represented an interest payment on the deeplydiscounted convertible senior notes the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at the fremont factory and gigafactory shanghai the decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue primarily due to delivery of regulatory credits in 2020 under a previous arrangement where we had received payment in advance as of december 31 2019 a larger increase in operating lease vehicles as model 3 direct leasing was introduced in the second quarter of 2019 and model y direct leasing was introduced in the third quarter of 2020 and a larger increase in accounts receivables of government rebates already passed through to customers 

cash flows from investing activities

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 316 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 mainly for model y production expansion at the fremont factory expansion of gigafactory shanghai and construction of gigafactory berlin and gigafactory texas  and 133 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 mainly for gigafactory shanghai construction model 3 production ramp and model y preparations  the increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by decreases of 32 million in business combinations net of cash acquired and 30 million of design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems when compared to the prior year additionally we received 123 million and 46 million respectively of government grants in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment investments at gigafactory shanghai for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

cash flows from financing activities

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 consisted primarily of 1227 billion from issuance of common stock in public offerings in 2020 net of issuance costs and 417 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances these cash inflows were partially offset by 199 billion of cash repayments upon early conversions of our convertible senior notes 338 million principal repayments of our finance leases collateralized lease repayments of 240 million and 219 million net payments to financing fund investors see note 12 debt  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings respectively

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2019 consisted primarily of 182 billion from the issuance of the 200 convertible senior notes due in 2024 “2024 notes” net of transaction costs and 848 million from the issuance of common stock net of underwriting discounts in registered public offerings 736 million of net borrowings under loan agreements entered into by certain chinese subsidiaries 394 million of net borrowings for automotive assetbacked notes and 174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 notes these cash inflows were partially offset by a 732 million portion of the repayment of our 025 convertible senior notes due in 2019 that was classified as financing activity a 566 million repayment of our 1625 convertible senior notes due in 2019 a purchase of convertible note hedges of 476 million in connection with the offering of the 2024 notes and collateralized lease repayments of 389 million 

 

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing facilities and certain corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts the following table sets forth as of december 31 2020 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in millions

 



 





the table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of 353 million because if recognized they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners refer to automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options would be 184 billion over the next five years of which 394 million is within a 12month period from december 31 2020 we have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many customers will exercise their options additionally we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore the actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited

offbalance sheet arrangements

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2017related items refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2018 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 19 2019

overview and 2019 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products

automotive

during 2019 we achieved annual vehicle delivery and production records of 367656 and 365232 total vehicles respectively we also laid the groundwork for our next phase of growth with the commencement of model 3 production at gigafactory shanghai preparations at the fremont factory for model y production which commenced in the first quarter of 2020 the selection of berlin germany as the site for our next factory for the european market and the unveiling of cybertruck we also continued to enhance our user experience through improved autopilot and fsd features including the introduction of a new powerful onboard fsd computer and a new smart summon feature and the expansion of a unique set of incar entertainment options

energy generation and storage

we revamped key aspects of our solar operations in 2019 by streamlining traditionally complex ordering permitting installation and backend service processes to enhance the customer experience especially for retrofit solar installations our solar deployments grew approximately 48 and 26 quarteroverquarter in the second half of the year we also deployed 165 gwh of energy storage in 2019 more than the aggregate of all prior years finally we further evolved our product offerings by launching the third generation of the solar roof for which we are expanding both our manufacturing and installation capabilities and megapack our largest utilityscale energy storage product to date 

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2020 outlook

automotive—production 

a key focus in 2020 will be our efforts towards establishing and expanding capacity for vehicle production at volume across three continents at the fremont factory we commenced model y production earlier than anticipated and combined with model 3 we have installed annual production capacity for 400000 vehicles we expect to further increase this capacity to 500000 vehicles through the installation of additional equipment 

at gigafactory shanghai we have installed annual production capacity for 150000 model 3 vehicles that we believe we will eventually be able to push to actual rates of production in excess of such number  subject to local production of battery packs which we began ramping there later than other processes we have commenced construction of the next phase of gigafactory shanghai to add model y manufacturing capacity at least equivalent to that for model 3 to finance our construction and expansion in december 2019 our local subsidiary entered into a rmb 90 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars fixed asset term facility and a rmb 225 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars working capital revolving facility part of which was used to repay a rmb 35 billion bridge loan entered into in march 2019  we are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditures 

 

finally we have selected germany as the site of our next factory for manufacturing vehicles for the european marke t due to its strong manufacturing and engineering presence  however the construction of and ramp at gigafactory berlin as well as at gigafactory shanghai  are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements maintenance of operational licenses and approvals for additional e xpansion  potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale  ultimately achieving increased total vehicle production costeffectively across all of our manufacturing operations will require that we timely address any bottlenecks that may arise as we ramp establish and maintain sustained supplier capacity and successfully utilize manufacturing processes at the maximum output rates that we have planned for them 

automotive—demand and sales

as the automotive industry continues to validate and grow the market for electric vehicles we are generating demand and new customers even without traditional marketing and with relatively low marketing costs and in 2019 our orders shifted to originating mostly from new customers without prior reservations production at gigafactory shanghai allows us to offer model 3 in china at competitive local pricing and more quickly which should drive further demand and opportunity in the world’s largest market for midsized premium sedans and we expect a similar impact in china for model y when we commence production there of this offering in the popular compact suv segment 

moreover the significant interest generated by our unveiling of cybertruck demonstrated our brand visibility innovation and viability across an increasing range of vehicle segments meanwhile we are making our existing vehicles incrementally more compelling including through a planned software update for fsdenabled vehicles to react to traffic lights and stop signs and navigate city intersections and additional functionality of both invehicle software and the tesla mobile app

 

on the other hand we may be impacted by trade and environmental policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations which are inherently unpredictable sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility specifically it is uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales finally we make certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business including as we introduce new vehicles and variants and optimize the pricing among them such pricing changes may impact our vehicles’ resale values and in turn our operating results for example if price reductions result in an increase to our estimates of the volume of vehicles that may potentially be returned to us under preexisting resale value guarantees provided to customers and partners for certain financing programs our gross profits may be reduced

automotive—deliveries and customer infrastructure

 

we continue to optimize our manufacturing and global delivery patterns to address higher volumes of our predominantly singlefactory production at the fremont factory we expect to alleviate any related issues through local production at gigafactory shanghai and eventually at gigafactory berlin 

we also continue to expand and invest in our servicing and charging locations and capabilities to keep pace with our customer vehicle fleet and ensure a convenient and efficient customer experience however if our customer vehicles particularly in the rapidly growing model 3 fleet experience unexpected reliability issues it could outpace and overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

 

we expect to continue to grow our retrofit solar system deployments as we execute our new strategy including through compelling financing options such as a subscriptionbased offering which is currently available in california 

 

we are focused on training our personnel and third party partners to ramp i nstallations of our solar roof  and are also hiring rapidly for its ongoing manufacturing ramp at gigafactory new york we expect such ramp will support our significant operations and our compliance with minimum hiring and cumulative investment targets under our agreement with the suny foundation related to the construction and use of gigafactory new york however if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at buffalo or our production ramp of the solar roof prove incorrect we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the suny foundation 

finally with the introduction of our 3 mwh megapack we now offer an even greater variety of scalable energy storage products with a wide range of markets and applications and expect this product to drive additional interest from global project developers and utilities 

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses

our capital expenditures are difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time for example the curve of any new product ramp such as for model y and the solar roof is inherently subject to uncertainty of timing and if we are able to meet various milestones along such ramp more quickly than expected our capital expenditures may be accelerated we also continuously evaluate and as appropriate adjust our capital expenditures based on among other things our manufacturing plans for our various products which we may rebalance from time to time based on the mix of demand among them and other contingent factors the pace and prioritization of current projects under development and the addition of any new projects moreover we are generally increasing the capital efficiency of our projects with experience  and we may find that our actual capital expenditures on new projects are different than previously expected 

subject to the above considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products construction and expansion of our factories and pipeline of announced projects under development and consistent with our current strategy of using partners to manufacture battery cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be 25 billion to 35 billion

we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future as we focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation as well as from increases in expected overall revenues from our expanding sales in particular our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business have already manifested in total operating expenses decreasing from 44 billion to 41 billion from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019 including restructuring and other charges meanwhile our total revenues increased from 215 billion to 246 billion in the same period

in march 2018 our stockholders approved the 2018 ceo performance award with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones we will incur significant noncash stockbased compensation expense for each tranche under this award after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met and if later than the grant date we will also have to record a cumulative catchup expense at such time such catchup expense may be material depending on the length of time elapsed from the grant date for example in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the result of an additional operational milestone becoming probable of achievement we recorded a cumulative catchup expense of 72 million for service provided from the grant date moreover as the expense for a tranche is recorded over the longer of i the expected achievement period of the relevant operational milestone and ii only if the related market capitalization milestone has not been achieved its expected achievement period the achievement of a market capitalization milestone earlier than expected may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized upon vesting of a tranche all remaining associated expense will be recognized immediately see note 14 equity incentive plans—2018 ceo performance award  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding the stockbased compensation relating to the 2018 ceo performance award

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

adoption of new revenue standard

on january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  “new revenue standard” using the modified retrospective method the new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

automotive segment

automotive sales revenue 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot fsd features and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle revenue related to autopilot and fsd features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue 

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot fsd features and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

 

automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value

with the exception of two programs which are discussed within the automotive leasing section we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns as we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values the two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option and vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised for certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840 leases prior to january 1 2019 we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate the remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciated their value less estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

automotive regulatory credits 

in connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable automotive regulatory credits we have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements for example under california’s zero emission vehicle regulation and those of states that have adopted california’s standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits referred to as zev credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements these laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws we also earn other types of saleable regulatory credits in the united states and abroad including greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuels credits  payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

automotive leasing revenue 

automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases

direct vehicle leasing program 

we have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in the us canada and in certain countries in europe as of december 31 2019 the direct vehicle leasing program is offered for all new model s model x and model 3 vehicles in the us and new model s and model x vehicles in canada qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for model s and model x leases may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases we record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

we capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option 

we offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the united states these transactions entail a transfer of leases which we have originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner as control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transactions were accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with asc 840 leases  prior to january 1 2019  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment is recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under asc 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term consequently any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue the end customers can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

for certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise we have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheets to used vehicle inventory

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage sales 

energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers including solar subscriptionbased arrangements upon adoption of asc 842 energy generation and storage sales revenue includes agreements for solar energy systems and ppas that commence after january 1 2019 as these are now accounted for under the new revenue standard sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business

for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance

 

in instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems as our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred 

as part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract in certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur

we record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term 

energy generation and storage leasing 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas prior to january 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 

we capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and ppas which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

 

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

warranties

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and production powertrain components and systems we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met if such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time if the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized if additional operational milestones become probable stockbased compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catchup expense for the service provided since the grant date the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations

 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2019 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs  the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation

 

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

 

 

results of operations

revenues

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash sales of new model s model x and model 3 vehicles including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot and fsd features and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting 

automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for model s model x and model 3 vehicles under direct lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting we began offering direct leasing for model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue

 

201 9 compared to 201 8 

automotive sales revenue increased 232 billion or 13 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to an increase of 137969 model 3 cash deliveries from production scaling and an increase of 175 million in sales of regulatory credits to 594 million the increase was partially offset by a decrease of 30487 model s and model x cash deliveries the deliveries in the year ended december 31 2019 were at lower average selling prices than the prior year due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings and the introduction of lower end model 3 trims in 2019 due to the price adjustments we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments as a result along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of 555 million refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

automotive leasing revenue decreased 14 million or 2 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases the decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program partially due to the introduction of model 3 direct leasing in the second quarter of 2019 

services and other revenue increased 835 million or 60 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of tradein vehicles partially offset by lower average selling prices for tradedin tesla vehicles due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019 additionally there was an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives

2019 compared to 2018 

energy generation and storage revenue decreased by 24 million or 2 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to decreases in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs partially offset increases in deployments of powerwall powerpack and megapack 

 

cost of revenues and gross margin 

 



 

automotive  services and other segment

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs

costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services  costs to acquire and certify used vehicles costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

 

201 9 compared to 201 8 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 225 billion or 16 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to an increase of 137969 model 3 cash deliveries and higher average model s and model x costs per unit compared to the prior year due to the discontinuation of lower end trims in 2019 the increases were partially offset by a decrease of 30487 model s and model x cash deliveries and a decrease in average model 3 costs per unit compared to the prior year primarily due to lower end trims introduced in 2019 and temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 additionally due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019 we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments if customers elect to exercise the buyback options we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles which resulted in a reduction of automotive cost of sales of 451 million for the year ended december 31 2019 refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased 29 million or 6 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cumulative vehicles under our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases the decrease was partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program partially due to the introduction of model 3 leasing in the second quarter of 2019 

cost of services and other revenue increased 890 million or 47 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to the costs of used vehicle sales from the increased volumes of tradein vehicles additionally there were increases in the costs of our new service centers additional service personnel in existing and new service centers mobile service capabilities parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles 

gross margin for total automotive decreased from 23 to 21 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to lower model s and model x margins from lower selling prices due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings in 2019 a higher proportion of model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales compared to the prior period additionally the price adjustments also resulted in a reduction in gross automotive sales profit of 104 million from the adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program the decrease was partially offset by improvement of model 3 margins compared to the prior year as we achieved additional manufacturing efficiencies in the production of model 3 and an increase of 175 million in sales of regulatory credits

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment decreased from 19 to 17 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a higher proportion of services and other within the segment which operates at lower gross margins than our automotive business 

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets in addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 

2019 compared to 2018 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue decreased by 24 million  or 2 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in deployments of solar cash and loan jobs partially offset by increases in deployments of powerwall powerpack and megapack

 

gross margin for energy generation and storage remained relatively consistent at 12 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  energy storage gross margins improved in the current year as a result of lower materials costs partially offset by lower gross margins in our cash and loan solar business driven by higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar r oof ramp 

research and development expense

 



 

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense

rd expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 7 to 5 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales as well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business 

rd expenses decreased 117 million or 8 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 95 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from cost efficiency initiatives and a 26 million decrease in professional and outside service expenses

selling general and administrative expense

 



 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements

sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13 to 11 in year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily from an increase in overall revenues from our expanding sales as well as from our focus on increasing operational efficiency and process automation our efforts to scale down and optimize our cost structure relative to the size of our business 

sga expenses decreased 189 million or 7 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 302 million decrease in employee and labor related expenses from decreased headcount and cost efficiency initiatives partially offset by a 112 million increase in stockbased compensation expense the increase in stockbased compensation expense was primarily related to the 2018 ceo performance award as we recorded a 72 million cumulative catchup expense for the service provided from the grant date when an additional operational milestone was considered probable of being met in the fourth quarter of 2019 additionally the expense period was shorter in the prior year as it commenced upon the grant approval date of march 21 2018

 

restructuring and other 

 



 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we carried out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency as a result we recognized  50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments we recognized  47 million in impairment related to the iprd intangible asset as we abandoned further development efforts refer to note 4 goodwill and intangible assets for details and  15 million for the related equipment within the energy generation and storage segment we also incurred a loss of  37 million for closing operations in certain facilities on the statement of cash flows the amounts were presented in the captions in which such amounts would have been recorded absent the impairment charges the employee termination expenses were substantially paid by december 31 2019 while the remaining amounts were noncash

during the year ended december 31 2018 we carriedout certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized  37 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from subleasing a certain facility the employee termination cash expenses of  27 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018 while the remaining amounts were noncash also included within restructuring and other activities was  55 million of expenses materially all of which were noncash from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty in addition we concluded that a small portion of the iprd asset is not commercially feasible consequently we recognized an impairment loss of  13 million we recognized settlement and legal expenses of  30 million in the year ended december 31 2018 for the settlement with the sec relating to a takeprivate proposal for tesla these expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018  

interest expense

 



 

interest expense increased by 22 million or 3 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness at relatively consistent weighted average interest rates as compared to the year ended december 31 2018

other income expense net

 



 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates

 

other income expense net increased   by 23 million  or 105 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  offset by losses from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities yearoveryear 

provision for income taxes

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 52 million or 90 in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 



 

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests changed unfavorably by 174 million in the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the change was primarily due to lower activities in our financing fund arrangements

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2019 we had 627 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 126 billion and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and canadian dollars our sources of cash are predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products establishment andor increases of model 3 and model y production capacity at the fremont factory and at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory nevada the construction of gigafactory berlin the manufacturing ramp of the solar roof at gigafactory new york and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network 

as discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—management opportunities challenges and risks and 2020 outlook—trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses in this annual report on form 10k considering the expected pace of the manufacturing ramps for our products construction and expansion of our factories and pipeline of projects under development and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture battery cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth we currently expect our average annual capital expenditures in 2020 and the two succeeding fiscal years to be 25 billion to 35 billion

 

we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources for example we expect that much of our investment in gigafactory shanghai will continue to be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in china such as the rmb 90 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars fixed asset term facility and rmb 225 billion or the equivalent amount in us dollars working capital revolving facility that our local subsidiary entered into in december 2019 and we expect the same with respect to gigafactory berlin  as always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business  to further strengthen our balance sheet or for general corporate purposes  

we have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory new york we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

in addition we had 303 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of december 31 2019 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds upon the drawdown of any unused committed amounts there are no restrictions on use of available funds for general corporate purposes for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to note 12 debt  and note 17 variable interest entity arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

summary of cash flows

 



 

cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 307 million to  241   billion during the year ended december 31 2019 from 210 billion during the year ended december 31 2018 this favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of  902 million partially offset by the increase in net operating assets and liabilities of 407 million and 188 million of the repayment of our 025 convertible senior notes due in 2019 which was classified as an operating activity as this represented an interest payment on the discounted convertible notes the increase in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2019 as compared to 2018 as we were ramping for model 3 production in 2018 and a larger increase in operating lease vehicles in 2019 as compared to 2018 as we began offering model 3 leasing in 2019 the increase in net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in inventory and a larger increase in deferred revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 

cash flows from investing activities

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 133 billion during 2019 mainly for gigafactory shanghai construction model 3 production and model y preparations and 210 billion during 2018 mainly for model 3 production design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems amounted to 105 million and 218 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

  cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2019 consisted primarily of 182 billion from the issuance of the 200 convertible senior notes due in 2024 “ 2024 notes” net of transaction costs and 848 million from the issuance of common stock net of underwriting discounts in registered public offerings 736 million of net borrowings under loan agreements entered into by certain chinese subsidiaries 394 million of net borrowings for automotive assetbacked notes and 174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 notes these cash inflows were partially offset by a 732 million portion of the repayment of our 025 convertible senior notes due in 2019 that was classified as financing activity a 566 million repayment of our 1625 convertible senior notes due in 2019 a purchase of convertible note hedges of 476 million in connection with the offering of the 2024 notes and collateralized lease repayments of 389 million  see note 12 debt  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings respectively

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2018 consisted primarily of 118 billion of net borrowings under automobile assetbacked notes 431 million of net borrowings under the senior secured assetbased revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” 334 million from the issuance of solar assetbacked notes and 296 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances these cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of 582 million under our vehicle leasebacked loan and security agreements the “warehouse agreements” collateralized lease repayments of 559 million repayments of 230 million of the 275 convertible senior notes due on november 1 2018 and repayments of 210 million under the revolving aggregation credit facility

 

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing and corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts the following table sets forth as of december 31 2019 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in millions

 

 



 





the table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of 247 million because if recognized they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners refer to automotive sales with resale value guarantee or a buyback option in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options would be 170 billion over the next five years of which 226 million is within a 12month period from december 31 2019 we have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many customers will exercise their options additionally we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore the actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

we lease and sell retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers and are ramping our solar roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive integrated styling our energy storage products which we manufacture at gigafactory 1 consist of powerwall mostly for residential applications and powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications

during 2018 we deployed 104 gwh of energy storage products nearly tripling our 358 mwh of energy storage deployments during 2017 we also deployed 326 megawatts “mw” of solar energy generation during 2018

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2019 outlook

automotive demand production and deliveries

our goal is to produce the world’s highest quality vehicles as quickly and as costeffectively as possible with a priority on workplace health and safety the worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and selfdriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so a growing number of companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand and in some cases fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles andor to develop selfdriving technologies however we believe that the unique features of our vehicles the safety aspects of each of our vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with model 3 the innovation and expansion of our global retail service and charging operations and infrastructure and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets 

 

model 3 was the bestselling premium vehicle in the united states in 2018 vehicles traded in to us by model 3 customers continue to suggest the existence of a wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owners of midsized premium sedans moreover as we have offered only the longrange midrange and performance variants of model 3 thus far we believe that we will see increased demand with the introduction of less expensive variants such as a version with a base price of 35000 that we intend to offer in the future and additional financing options we commenced in january 2019 production of model 3 for europe and china each of which we believe has a much larger midsized premium sedan market than north america where we have exclusively delivered model 3 to date we also believe that we have an advantage over our competitors with respect to our battery and powertrain technology as our vehicles’ eparated range per kwh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicles to be introduced in the near term and we have the ability to improve our vehicles through overtheair software updates we are producing variants including regional versions of model 3 in accordance with the demand that we expect for them however and we have finite production capabilities with long lead times associated with procuring certain parts if our model 3 demand expectations prove inaccurate or we experience delays in introducing planned additional variants including as we begin offering model 3 in new markets we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce we may also be impacted by trade policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies in addition the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in the us was reduced to 3750 for any tesla vehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of 2019 and will be further reduced to 1875 for each tesla vehicle delivered in the third or fourth quarter of 2019 and to 0 for each tesla vehicle delivered thereafter we believe that this phaseout likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into 2018 and could create similar pullforwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit in the long run we do not expect a meaningful impact to our sales in the us as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a compelling proposition even without incentives globally we are also working to and in some cases have already begun to increase the value proposition and affordability of our offerings to customers and offer other financing arrangements over time for example we intend to introduce leasing options for model 3 

our model 3 production ramped dramatically during 2018 and we expect to continue to grow model 3 production to a sustained rate of 7000 vehicles per week at our tesla factory by the end of 2019 as we ramp international deliveries we remain focused on further cost improvements and on increasing the affordability of model 3 furthermore in january 2019 we commenced construction of our gigafactory shanghai in china we expect to build a production process that is optimized and simplified for model 3 production comprised of stamping body joining and paint shops and general assembly at gigafactory shanghai to begin production of certain trims of model 3 for china by the end of 2019 we believe that the efficiencies of local production as well as avoiding certain tariffs on usmanufactured vehicles will allow us to offer model 3 at a lower average selling price in the largest market for electric vehicles in the world inclusive of gigafactory shanghai our goal is to be able to produce 10000 model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of 500000 model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 however the timeframe for gigafactory shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online ultimately achieving increased model 3 production costeffectively will require that we timely address any additional bottlenecks that may arise as we continue to ramp and establish sustained supplier capacity including locally at gigafactory shanghai 

we also recently discontinued new custom orders for the 75 kwh versions of model s and model x to focus on longer range versions of our highestperformance flagship vehicles and further differentiate them from model 3 we have gradually increased the level of option standardization across these models and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed us to reduce the production hours for them while preserving the flexibility to increase output as necessary as model s and model x are produced in the us for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duties on components sourced from china as well as by tariffs on vehicles exported to china although we intend to partially divert such deliveries to north america and europe if necessary

 

advancing our customerfacing infrastructure remains a top priority delivering vehicles to our customers and the related logistics were challenging during 2018 but we continue to improve these processes to maximize customer satisfaction including by purchasing our own carhauling trucks we are also expanding our servicing capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet including by growing our service locations and mobile service fleet moving to twoshift operations at service centers where needed and optimizing our parts distribution network we are also updating the tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointments in order to increase customer convenience as sales of tesla vehicles ramp further we plan to continue to open new tesla retail locations service centers and body shops around the world and we plan to continue to expand our mobile service fleet we also plan to continue to significantly increase the number of superchargers and destination charging connectors globally as well as evolve our supercharger technology to enable faster charging times while reducing our related costs however we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver an increasing number of vehicles and we have only limited experience with this at scale particularly in markets outside of north america moreover if our growing fleet of customer vehicles particularly model 3 experiences unexpected reliability issues it could overburden our servicing capabilities 

 

finally we are making progress with our selfdriving technology as well as the autopilot features in our vehicles our neural net and functionality continue to improve and we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release key version updates recently we launched a “navigate on autopilot” feature that allows enabled tesla vehicles under appropriate circumstances and driver input to change lanes transition between freeways and exit freeways while we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy additionally there is growing competition from other automobile and technology companies in the area of selfdriving

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

we are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products transitioning away from former channel partners and shifting our sales strategy significantly to sell these products in tesla stores and on our website and through crossselling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners as we continue to implement this strategy we expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will decrease slightly before stabilizing and growing in the second half of the year including through crossselling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners our emphasis for retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront cash generation and profitability rather than absolute volume growth such as by reducing the mix of leased systems and prioritizing residential installations that are combined with our energy storage products

we are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our solar roof product and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with the expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019

we expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth and we are targeting to more than double our deployments to over 2 gwh in 2019 we see opportunities in north america as well as in australia and europe where energy storage coupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rates as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability we are continuing to ramp production for these products at gigafactory 1 including through a new production line and we have seen further manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes as we ramp

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses

capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately 25 billion mostly to support increases in model 3 production capacity at gigafactory 1 and the tesla factory the establishment of model 3 production capacity at gigafactory shanghai and the addition of manufacturing capacity for model y which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020 as well as the ongoing expansion of our retail locations service centers body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger stations

generally we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected revenues and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency in addition due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational efficiency we expect operating expenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10 from 2018

 

in march 2018 our stockholders approved a new 10year ceo performance award for elon musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones the “2018 ceo performance award” consequently we may incur significant additional noncash stockbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting 

automotive financing options

we offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners currently both programs are available only in certain international markets resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following december 31 2018 totaled 1497 million in value

we have adopted the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 effective january 1 2018 this impacts the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners which now generally qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return in addition for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018 we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used vehicles in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows to date we have only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us based on current market demand for our vehicles we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts but resale prices may inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially

we currently offer model s and model x leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the us and canada  we also offer leasing through leasing partners in certain jurisdictions leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk in addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities we assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers to the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

energy generation and storage financing options

we offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements these contractual arrangements include longterm leases and ppas in both structures we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee in the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee in the ppa structure we charge customers a fee per kilowatthour or kwh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces the leases and ppas are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations

for customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems we also offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced by us we enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with a thirdparty lender who finances the full purchase price we are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan

 

gigafactory 1 

we continue to develop gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products we also continue to invest in the future expansion of gigafactory 1 and in additional production capacity there for example we have announced that we will likely manufacture model y at gigafactory 1

panasonic has partnered with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices as these terms convey to us the right to use as defined in asc 840 leases  their production equipment we consider them to be leased assets when production commences this results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations for all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 we will apply similar accounting during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded 7666 million on the consolidated balance sheet

while we currently believe that our progress at gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp for example we have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at gigafactory 1 which negatively affected our production of model 3 while we continue to resolve such issues at gigafactory 1 as they arise given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate

gigafactory 2

we have an agreement with the suny foundation for the construction of a factory with the intended capacity to produce at least 10 gw of solar products annually in buffalo new york referred to as gigafactory 2 in december 2016 we entered into an agreement with panasonic under which it manufactures custom pv cells and modules for us primarily at gigafactory 2 and we purchase certain quantities of pv cells and modules from panasonic during the 10year term

the terms of our agreement with the suny foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the suny foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits

gigafactory shanghai

we are constructing gigafactory shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of model 3 for customers in china by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the us we broke ground in january 2019 and subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to begin production of certain trims of model 3 at gigafactory shanghai by the end of 2019 we expect much of the investment in gigafactory shanghai to be provided through local debt financing supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us moreover we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our model 3 production at the tesla factory from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at gigafactory shanghai

other manufacturing

we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities and construct our planned facilities and continually explore additional production capacity internationally 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

adoption of new revenue standard

on january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers “new revenue standard” using the modified retrospective method the new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

automotive segment

automotive sales revenue 

automotive sales without resale value guarantee 

automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates we recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business other features and services such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle revenue related to autopilot and full selfdriving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 

at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue 

costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates as our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

 

automotive sales with resale value guarantee 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value

with the exception of two programs which are discussed within the automotive leasing section we now recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise the performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values the two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option and vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised for certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840 leases  we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate the remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciated their value less estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

automotive regulatory credits 

california and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zeroemission vehicles these laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zeroemission vehicles may earn regulatory credits “zev credits” and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers as a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have earned emission credits such as zev and ghg credits on our vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future we enter into contractual agreements with thirdparties to purchase our regulatory credits payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

automotive leasing revenue 

automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases

direct vehicle leasing program 

we have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the us canada and europe currently the direct vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the us and canada qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases we record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

we capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option 

we offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees to certain leasing partner sales in the united states these transactions entail a transfer of leases which we have originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner as control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with asc 840 leases  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee where exercise is probable 

for certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases the process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise we have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

services and other revenue 

services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers there were no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard 

revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer we sell used vehicles services service plans vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations payment for used vehicles services and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet 

energy generation and storage segment

energy generation and storage sales 

energy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and accepted by the customer payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business

 

for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance 

in instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems as our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred

as part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract in certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur

we record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term 

energy generation and storage leasing 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 

 

we capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or ppas which include the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or ppa 

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

warranties

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new revenue standard automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures

 

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations

income taxes

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2018 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the tax act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets

 

in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date as such in accordance with sab 118 we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior year 

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs  the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

 

business combinations 

we account for business acquisitions under asc 805 business combinations  the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed we recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests we include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date

when determining such fair values we make significant estimates and assumptions critical estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from our estimates furthermore our estimates might change as additional information becomes available as more fully discussed in note 3 business combinations  included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

2018 compared to 2017 

automotive sales revenue increased 910 billion or 107 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to an increase of approximately 144330 model 3 deliveries from our significant production ramp in the year ended december 31 2018 delivered at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent yearoveryear additionally we recognized 140 billion of additional automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase of 583 million in sales of regulatory credits to 4186 million in the year ended december 31 2018 zev credits sales were 1034 million and nonzev regulatory credits sales were 3152 million in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2797 million zev credit sales and 806 million in nonzev regulatory credit sales in the year ended december 31 2017 the growth in nonzev regulatory credits yearoveryear was generally consistent with the delivery volume growth the above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 3240 model s and model x deliveries during the year ended december 31 2018 excluding the impact of adoption of the new revenue standard at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 

automotive leasing revenue decreased 2231 million or 20 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of 8327 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 when our counterparty retains ownership any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee are settled to automotive leasing revenue

services and other revenue increased 3899 million or 39 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of tradein vehicles partially offset by lower average selling prices for used vehicles sales due to an increase in tradeins of relatively lower priced nontesla vehicles in the year ended december 31 2018 additionally there was an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow these increases were partially offset by a decrease in powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017

2017 compared to 2016 

automotive sales revenue increased 295 billion or 53 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily related to a 58 increase in deliveries to 80060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of model s and model x at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period as well as sales of 1764 model 3 vehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017 additionally sales of regulatory credits increased by 580 million to 3603 million in the year ended december 31 2017 zev credits sales were 2797 million and nonzev regulatory credits sales were 806 million in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2154 million zev credit sales and 869 million in nonzev regulatory credit sales in the year ended december 31 2016 the increases were partially offset by additional deferrals of autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended december 31 2017

automotive leasing revenue increased 3448 million or 45 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantees as compared to the year ended december 31 2016

service and other revenue increased 5332 million or 114 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from the expansion of our tradein program additionally there was a 411 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from grohmann engineering gmbh now tesla grohmann automation gmbh which we acquired on january 3 2017 and a 684 million increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended december 31 2017

 

energy generation and storage segment 

energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and ppas and the sale of solar energy systems incentives

2018 compared to 2017 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 4390 million or 39 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to increases in deployments of powerpack powerwall and cash and loan solar energy systems projects the increase in powerpack revenue was significant yearoveryear due to increases in revenue recognized for commercial projects most predominantly 812 million for the south australia battery project additionally we increased powerwall production in the year ended december 31 2018 which helped us to continue to work through our energy storage order backlog 

2017 compared to 2016 

energy generation and storage revenue increased by 9349 million or 515 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november 21 2016

cost of revenues and gross margin

 



 

 

automotive  services and other segment

cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs

costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services  costs to acquire and certify used vehicles and costs for retail merchandise cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers

2018 compared to 2017 

cost of automotive sales revenue increased 696 billion or 104 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to a significantly higher volume of model 3 vehicles deliveries in 2018 and the recognition of 9698 million of additional cost of automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard these increases were partially offset by significant reductions in model 3 average costs per unit compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in 2017 and other cost efficiencies additionally there were lower overall costs for model s and model x cash deliveries from approximately 3240 fewer units delivered yearoveryear and reductions in combined model s and model x average costs per unit as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies 

cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased 2198 million or 31 in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of 6244 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 when our counterparty retains ownership the net book value of the leased vehicle of the lease vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue

cost of services and other revenue increased 6513 million or 53 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service centers additional service personnel in existing and new service centers mobile service capabilities parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles additionally there was an overall increase in the cost of used vehicle sales from the increased volume of relatively lower priced nontesla tradein vehicles these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017

 

gross margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent at 23 in the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 there were increases from improved model s and model x combined margins as costs per unit decreased yearoveryear from continuing manufacturing efficiencies and an increase in regulatory credits sales which have no associated costs the increases were partially offset by margin dilution from model 3 despite model 3 margins improving yearoveryear the higher proportion of model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended december 31 2018 lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive as model 3 had a lower annualized margin than model s and model x due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of model 3 

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19 in the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above services and other has historically operated at lower margins than our automotive sales and leasing business but has a small impact on the overall segment margin because of its relatively small revenue base

2017 compared to 2016 

cost of automotive sales revenues increased 246 billion or 58 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to a 58 increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of model s and model x as well as the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2262 million or 47 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees

cost of services and other revenue increased 7566 million or 160 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow

gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25 to 23 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps and increases in early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees yearoveryear contributed to the lower gross margin lower material and manufacturing costs for model s and model x as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended december 31 2017 partially offset the overall decrease

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment decreased from 23 to 19 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 these decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive as explained above as well as higher costs of maintenance service

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets in addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 

 

2018 compared to 2017 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 4904 million or 56 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to increases in deployments of powerpack powerwall and cash and loan solar energy system projects the increase in powerpack cost of revenue was significant yearoveryear due to increases in cost of revenue recognized for commercial projects most predominantly 725 million for the south australia battery project additionally costs for cash and loan solar energy system projects have increased from higher installation costs higher allocation of overhead costs from lower deployment of solar projects overall and certain warranty related onetime charges there were also higher costs for our solar energy system leasing arrangements due to impairment charges and higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar roof ramp

gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 22 to 12 in the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to the higher proportion of energy storage of our overall energy generation and storage portfolio due to a threefold growth of mwh of energy storage deployments in the year ended december 31 2018 although energy storage margins have improved significantly as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 it continues to operate at a lower margin than our solar business thereby having a greater dilutive impact on our gross margin in the year ended december 31 2018 additionally increases in costs for our cash and loan solar energy system projects impairment charges on solar energy system leasing arrangements and temporary manufacturing underutilization of our solar roof ramp have further contributed to the decrease in gross margin

2017 compared to 2016 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 6962 million or 390 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november 21 2016

gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2 to 22 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this was predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue and costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity

interest expense

 



 

interest expense increased by 1918 million or 41 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness at relatively consistent weighted average interest rates as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 additionally there was a decrease of 700 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statement of operations to property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets lower capitalization results in higher interest expense the amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance which decreased yearoveryear due to significant model 3 capital expenditure ramp in the year ended december 31 2017 

interest expense increased by 2724 million or 137 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of interest expense from solarcity of 1855 million for the year ended december 31 2017 in addition our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 mainly due to the convertible senior notes due in 2022 and the senior notes due in 2025 both of which we issued during 2017

other income expense net

 



 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates

other income expense net changed favorably by 1472 million to a gain of 219 million in the year ended december 31 2018 from a loss of 1254 million in the year ended december 31 2017 the change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and gains from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities yearoveryear additionally we had 577 million of losses in the year ended december 31 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair values of certain solarcity liabilities as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 with no corresponding expense in the year ended december 31 2018

other income expense net changed unfavorably by 2367 million to a loss of 1254 million in the year ended december 31 2017 from a gain of 1113 million in the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily due to 577 million of losses in the year ended december 31 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of solarcity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 

provision for income taxes 

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 263 million or 83 in the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear

our provision for income taxes increased by 49 million or 18 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by 105 million of future us alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the tax act which previously had an associated valuation allowance

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 



 

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2018 we had 369 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 7490 million and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and japanese yen our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products increases in model 3 production capacity at the tesla factory the establishment of model 3 production capacity at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory 1 the addition of manufacturing capacity for model y with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of 2020 and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately 25 billion

 

in 2019  we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels for example based on our experience with ramping model 3 at the tesla factory we expect that the capital spend per unit of model 3 manufacturing capacity at gigafactory shanghai will be less than that of our line in fremont likewise based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between model y and model 3 we believe that the production ramp of model y will be significantly faster than that of model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of model 3 at fremont considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of gigafactory 1 gigafactory 2 and gigafactory shanghai  we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between 25 to 30 billion annually for the next two fiscal years   moreover we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations including the repayment of 9200 million for our 025 convertible senior notes due on march 1 2019 although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources for example we expect that much of our investment in gigafactory shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in china as always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business 

we have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory 2 we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops mobile service fleet and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected 

in addition we had 150 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of december 31 2018 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds upon the drawdown of any unused committed amounts there are no restrictions on the use of such funds for general corporate purposes for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to note 13 longterm debt obligations  and note 18 variable interest entity arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

 

summary of cash flows 

 



cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales lease payments directly from customers customer deposits sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings

net cash from operating activities changed favorably by 216 billion to net cash provided by operating activities of 210 billion during the year ended december 31 2018 from net cash used in operating activities of 607 million during the year ended december 31 2017 this favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 160 billion and the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 5546 million the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of increased expenditures to support our ramp of model 3 deliveries and a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue standard wherein certain vehicle sales to customer or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee were previously accounted for as an insubstance operating leases are now accounted for as sales with a right of return upon control transfer the increase in cash from certain operating activities was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of increased model 3 and energy products deliveries and production additionally there was a decrease in customer deposits primarily due to model 3 fulfillments and an increase in other assets as we paid 1413 million for the land use rights for gigafactory shanghai

net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017 decreased by 632 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 1973 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss excluding noncash expenses and gains of 1341 million the decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 7730 million the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 7506 million as our business expanded the increase in resale value guarantees of 3269 million and deferred revenue of 3830 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of 3884 million primarily due to model 3 reservations these increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 247 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee

cash flows from investing activities

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 232 billion during 2018 408 billion during 2017 and 144 billion during 2016 capital expenditures during 2018 were 210 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for model 3 production and the expansion of our customer support infrastructure and 2188 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers 

 

capital expenditures during 2017 were 341 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for model 3 production and 6665 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers we also paid 1145 million net of the cash acquired for acquisitions in 2017 

capital expenditures during 2016 were 128 billion from purchases of property and equipment and 1597 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers these expenditures were partially offset by the assumed cash of 3427 million as a result of the solarcity acquisition in 2016

in 2014 we began construction of gigafactory 1 we used 6870 million 145 billion and 4553 million of cash towards gigafactory 1 construction during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

cash flows from financing activities

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2018 consisted primarily of 118 billion of net borrowings under automobile assetbacked notes 4310 million of net borrowings under the senior secured assetbased revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” 3341 million from the issuance of solar assetbacked notes and 2957 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances these cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of 5819 million under our vehicle leasebacked loan and security agreements the “warehouse agreements” collateralized lease repayments of 5592 million repayments of 2300 million of the 275 convertible senior notes due on november 1 2018 and repayments of 2102 million under the revolving aggregation credit facility see note 13 longterm debt obligations  and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further details regarding our debt obligations and collateralized borrowings respectively

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2017 consisted primarily of 9664 million from the issuance of the 2375 convertible senior notes due in 2022 177 billion from the issuance of the 53 senior notes due in 2025 and 4002 million from our march 2017 public offering of common stock net of underwriter fees however we paid 1512 million for the purchase of bond hedges net of the amount we received from the sale of warrants furthermore we received 5113 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings and 5275 million of net proceeds from fund investors

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2016 consisted primarily of 170 billion from our may 2016 public offering of common stock net of underwriter fees 9954 million of proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments and 7697 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings the net proceeds from issuances of debt consisted primarily of 8340 million of net borrowings under the credit agreement and 3900 million of borrowings under the warehouse agreements partially offset by settlements of 4547 million for certain conversions of the 150 convertible senior notes due in june 2018 furthermore we received 1803 million of net proceeds from fund investors

 

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing and corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts the following table sets forth as of december 31 2018 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands

 

 



 





the table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of 2438 million because if recognized they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets

offbalance sheet arrangements

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

overview and 2017 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products we also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products

automotive

our production vehicle fleet includes our model s premium sedan and our model x sport utility vehicle which are our highestperformance vehicles and our model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which we began to produce and deliver in the second half of 2017 we continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates to provide additional safety convenience and performance features in addition we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline including those we unveiled in 2017 – an electric semitruck and a new version of the tesla roadster 

in 2017 our vehicle production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies and vehicle production volume increased by 20 yearoveryear additionally we delivered 101420 model s and model x vehicles and 1764 model 3 vehicles in 2017

energy generation and storage

we lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers we have partnered with panasonic to provide capital and operational support to manufacture pv cells thus enabling high volume integrated tile and pv cell production at our gigafactory 2 in buffalo new york we also recently commenced solar roof production at gigafactory 2 our energy storage products which we manufacture at gigafactory 1 consist of powerwall mostly for residential applications and powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications

in late 2017 we completed installation of the largest battery in the world in south australia this battery delivers electricity during peak hours to help maintain the reliable operation of south australia’s electrical infrastructure 

in 2017 we deployed 358 mwh of energy storage products and 523 mw of solar energy generation

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2018 outlook

automotive demand production and deliveries

we drive demand for our vehicles by continually improving our vehicles through overtheair software updates expanding our retail service and charging infrastructure and by periodically developing and introducing new passenger and commercial electric vehicle variants and models our goal is to become the best manufacturer in the automotive industry and having cutting edge robotic expertise inhouse is at the core of that goal our recent acquisitions of advanced automation companies have added to our talent base and are helping us increase vehicle production rates more effectively

the worldwide automotive market for alternative fuel vehicles and selfdriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so many companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand and in some cases fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles and to also develop selfdriving technologies we welcome the acceleration of the world’s transition to sustainable transport nonetheless we believe that the unique features of our vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with model 3 our global supercharger network and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets 

 

 

we expect model s and model x deliveries to be approximately 100000 in total in 2018  constrained by the supply of cells with the 18650 form factor used in those vehicles  as our sales network continues to expand to new markets in 2018 we believe vehicle orders should continue to grow  with demand outpacing production we plan to optimize the trim and option mix in order to optimize revenue and gross margin w e have made significant and sustained progress in the production processes of model s and model x  and we will continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies for these vehicles in 2018 

we expect model 3 production and deliveries to grow significantly in 2018 the initial phase of manufacturing any new vehicle is always challenging and the model 3 production ramp has been no exception particularly given our focus on highly automated manufacturing processes that we expect will ultimately result in higher volumes at significantly lower costs model 3 volume production has been less than we initially anticipated due to production bottlenecks with the battery module assembly line at gigafactory 1 being the primary production constraint to date although future bottlenecks in other areas of vehicle manufacturing may surface we have redirected our best engineering talent to gigafactory 1 to finetune the automated processes and related robotic programming not only to address the challenges we have experienced but also to continue evaluating our overall manufacturing process for efficiencies

based on our current progress we are targeting a production rate of 2500 model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5000 model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter it is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them our prior experience on the model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time we are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints and these actions should result in our model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018 in some cases we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines which may take us longer than anticipated in order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5000 units per week run rate

we are also making strides in other aspects of our vehicle production deliveries and customer infrastructure for example we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles due to economies of scale material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing and equipment utilization we have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control for model s and model x we have also seen improved product reliability in our vehicles batteries and drive units likewise we may experience infrastructure constraints and customer experience issues relating to vehicle deliveries but are trying to address such issues by opening additional delivery and service centers to scale the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver generally as sales of tesla vehicles ramp in 2018 we plan to continue to open new tesla retail locations service centers and delivery hubs around the world we plan continue to expand our mobile repair services and we plan to significantly increase the number of superchargers and destination charging connectors globally with the goal of remaining ahead of the model 3 ramp

we are also making progress with our selfdriving technology an overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has been completed which has enabled a stepchange improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities the aggregate of such data and learnings which we refer to as our “neural net” is able to collect and analyze more highquality data than ever before enabling us to rollout a series of new autopilot features in 2018 and beyond

energy generation and storage demand production and deployment

we are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products including by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling these products in tesla stores with dedicated energy product sales personnel and leveraging channel partnerships moreover we have deemphasized absolute volume growth for our solar products and we have instead prioritized projects for cash generation and profitability solar roof installations will initially ramp slowly in the first half of 2018 as solar roof is truly the firstofitskind and there is significant complexity in both its manufacturing and installation we are deliberately ramping production at a gradual pace to 

 

 

ensure reliability and a great customer experience with demand outpacing production we expect our backlog to remain in excess of one year for the next several quarters 

we expect energy storage products to experience significant growth with our aim being to at least triple our sales in 2018 we are ramping up production for these products at our gigafactory 1 over the next several quarters but demand is greater than our current production capacity for energy storage 

we expect energy generation and storage gross margin to improve significantly in 2018 as we enter the year with a backlog of highermargin commercial solar projects and a more profitable energy storage business due to overall cost and manufacturing efficiencies from scaling

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses

capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 with the majority of the spending to support increases in model 3 production capacity at gigafactory 1 and the tesla factory and for building additional stores service centers and superchargers

we expect operating expenses to grow in 2018 as compared to 2017 although operating expenses should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue due to the significant increase in expected revenue in 2018 and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency the growth in operating expense will mainly be driven by engineering design and testing of new products or changes to existing products and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence in addition we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of increased selling general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage business

we are seeking stockholder approval for a new 10year ceo performance award for elon musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones if tesla stockholders approve the award we would incur significant additional stockbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each performance milestone becomes probable of vesting

automotive financing options

we offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all direct customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners subsequent to june 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following december 31 2017 totaled  3757 million in value

we plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 effective january 1 2018 this will impact the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners which now will qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return in addition for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018 we will cease recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows through 2017 we only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially

we currently offer vehicle leases in the us for model s and model x directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity as well as through leasing partners leasing through tesla finance is available in 39 states and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangements through our entities in canada germany and the 

 

 

united kingdom leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk  in addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities  we assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers to the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

energy generation and storage financing options

we offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements these contractual arrangements include longterm leases and power purchase agreements in both structures we install our solar energy systems at our customer’s premises and charge the customer a monthly fee in the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee in the power purchase agreement structure we charge customers a fee per kilowatthour or kwh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces the leases and power purchase agreements are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and generally when there is no upfront prepayment the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations

for customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems we also offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced by us we enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with a thirdparty lender who finances the full purchase price we are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan 

gigafactory 1

we continue to develop gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products we also continue to invest in the future expansion of gigafactory 1 and in production equipment for battery cell module and pack production 

panasonic has partnered with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices as these terms convey to us the right to use as defined in asc 840 leases  their production equipment we consider them to be leased assets when production commences this results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations for all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 we will apply similar accounting during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded 4733 million on the consolidated balance sheet

while we currently believe that our progress at gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp for example we have experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at gigafactory 1 which has negatively affected our production of model 3 while we continue to make progress to resolve such issues at gigafactory 1 given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate

gigafactory 2

we have an agreement with the suny foundation for the construction of a factory capable of producing at least 10 gigawatts of solar cells annually in buffalo new york referred to as gigafactory 2 in december 2016 we entered into an agreement with panasonic under which it will manufacture custom pv cells and modules for us primarily at gigafactory 2 and we will purchase certain quantities of pv cells and modules from panasonic during the 10year term

 

 

the terms of our agreement with the suny foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the suny foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits 

other manufacturing

in addition we continue to expand production capacity at our tesla factory and are exploring additional production capacity in asia and europe

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

revenue recognition

we recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured

automotive segment

automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity free access to our supercharger network and future free overtheair software updates these other elements are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free fouryear period if we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available at the time of revenue recognition we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns such estimates are based on historical experience and were immaterial in all periods presented in addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing would be recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue in accordance with asc 60550 customer payments and incentives 

automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees see “vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee” “vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “direct vehicle leasing program” for further details

service and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans merchandise sales of used tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of nontesla vehicle tradeins

 

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee 

prior to june 30 2016 we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchased vehicles and who financed their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners since june 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a determined resale value although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee

we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners as we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840 under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantees for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue

on a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values

direct vehicle leasing program

we offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the north america and europe qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue

 

 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to four years or up to 50000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods

energy generation and storage segment

for solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price either directly or through the solar loan program revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met in instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as workinprogress in the consolidated balance sheet however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against energy generation and storage revenue in accordance with asc 60550 customer payments and incentives  revenue from an energy storage product sale is recognized when the product has been delivered installed and accepted by the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems including energy storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met for incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system we record revenue as the amounts are earned the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under ppas we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for in substance as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which are recognized as revenue over the lease term as well as the fees charged for remote monitoring service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term

we capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or ppas ie the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or ppa

inventory valuation

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff

 

 

we also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results

warranties

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell in addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years we accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims these estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or ppas as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenue

stockbased compensation

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the “espp” to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures

for performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement the fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulations

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense

income taxes

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the us and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and 

 

 

administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2017 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the us and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the tax act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets

in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date since the tax act was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of deferred tax remeasurements and other items such as state tax considerations to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 we do not expect any subsequent adjustments to have any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity “vie” of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not 

 

 

considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation 

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value “hlbv” method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

business combinations

we account for business acquisitions under asc 805 business combinations  the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed we recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests we include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date

when determining such fair values we make significant estimates and assumptions critical estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from our estimates furthermore our estimates might change as additional information becomes available as more fully discussed in note 3 business combinations  included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

cost of services and other revenue increased 7566 million or 160 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow

gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25 to 23 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the commencement of deliveries of model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps higher current period early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees as compared to the same period in the prior year contributed to the lower gross margin lower material and manufacturing costs for model s and model x as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 20 revenue in the current period partially offset the overall decrease

gross margin for total automotive  services and other segment decreased from 23 to 19 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 these decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive as explained above as well as higher costs of maintenance service

2016 compared to 2015 

cost of automotive revenues increased 163 billion or 62 to 427 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a fullyear of model x deliveries as well as increased deliveries for model s in addition the increase is due to product mix as model x has a higher cost structure than model s the increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of 200 million resulting from better vehicle reliability 

 

 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2986 million or 163 to 4820 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 1143 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees

research and development expense

 



 

research and development “rd” expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense

 

 

rd expenses increased 5437 million or 65 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due t o a 2749 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotiv e and energy generation and storage businesses and a 443 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants additionally there were increases in facilities expenses depreciation expenses professional and outside service expenses and expensed materials to support the development of future products  

rd expenses increased 1165 million or 16 to 8344 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase of 1165 million was primarily due to a 782 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 15 headcount increase as we expanded our vehicle business in the us and internationally and a 650 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants this is partially offset by a 259 million decrease in expensed materials related to our model x development which was primarily incurred in 2015 the overall increase also includes 110 million related to solarcity 

selling general and administrative expense

 



 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements

sga expenses increased 104 billion or 73 during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to a 5240 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses and a 649 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants additionally the increase was due to a 3106 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated expenses to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a 1406 million increase in professional and outside service expenses to support the growth of our business

sga expenses increased 5100 million or 55 to 143 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in sga expenses was primarily due to a 2472 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 61 increase in headcount as we expanded our business in the us and internationally a 910 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a 581 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to increased number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and existing employees the increase includes 743 million related to solarcity

 

 

interest expense 

 



 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 2724 million or 137 from the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of interest expense from solarcity of 1855 million for the year ended december 31 2017 in addition our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the prior year mainly due to the convertible senior notes due in 2022 and the senior notes due in 2025 both of which we issued during 2017

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 800 million or 67 from the year ended december 31 2015 the increase as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 consisted primarily of a 331 million increase in interest expense on vehicles sales that we account for as collateralized borrowing a 285 million increase in interest expense on buildtosuit leases and a 220 million increase in interest expense associated with solarcity’s indebtedness financing obligations and capital lease obligations

other income expense net

 



 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates additionally other income expense net includes a gain from the acquisition of solarcity for the year ended december 31 2016

other income expense net decreased by 2367 million or 213 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of solarcity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

other income net increased by 1529 million as we recognized a gain from the acquisition of solarcity of 887 million and a loss on conversion of our 150 convertible senior notes due in 2018 of 72 million the remainder of the change in other income expense net was primarily result of fluctuations in gains losses from foreign currency exchange

provision for income taxes

 



 

our provision for income taxes increased by 49 million or 18 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by 105 million of future us alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the tax act which previously had an associated valuation allowance

 

 

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was 267 million and 130 million respectively this increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

as of december 31 2017 we had 337 billion of cash and cash equivalents balances held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 5215 million and consisted primarily of chinese yuan euros and norwegian kroner our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings

our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects investments in tooling and manufacturing equipment for the production ramp of model 3 the continued construction of gigafactory 1 and the continued expansion of our retail stores service centers mobile repair services and supercharger network we are growing our vehicle manufacturing capacity primarily to fulfill model 3 production at 5000 vehicles per week and in a later phase to 10000 vehicles per week capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business

we have an agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory 2 we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at gigafactory 2 and other operations within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings stores service centers delivery centers and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected

in addition we had 204 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown for details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to note 13 convertible and longterm debt obligations  and note 18 vie arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

summary of cash flows

 

 



cash flows from operating activities

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales lease payments directly from customers customer deposits sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products these cash inflows are offset by our 

 

 

payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings 

net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017 decreased by 632 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 1973 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss excluding noncash expenses and gains of 1341 million the decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 7730 million the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 7506 million as our business expanded the increase in resale value guarantees of 3269 million and deferred revenue of 3830 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of 3884 million primarily due to model 3 reservations these increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 247 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 8887 million and the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 157 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee these increases were partially offset by the increase in resale value guarantees of 4423 million and deferred revenue of 3222 million as the number vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased

cash flows from investing activities

cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 408 billion during 2017 144 billion during 2016 and 163 billion during 2015 capital expenditures during 2017 were from 341 billion of purchases of property and equipment mainly for model 3 production and 6665 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers we also paid 1145 million net of the cash acquired for acquisitions in 2017

in 2014 we began construction of gigafactory 1 during 2017 we used cash of 145 billion towards gigafactory 1 construction

cash flows from financing activities

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2017 consisted primarily of 9664 million from the issuance of the convertible senior notes due in 2022 177 billion from the issuance of the senior notes due in 2025 and 4002 million from our march 2017 public offering of common stock net of underwriter fees however we paid 1512 million for the purchase of bond hedges net of the amount we received from the sale of warrants furthermore we received 5113 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings and 5275 million of net proceeds from fund investors

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2016 consisted primarily of 170 billion from our may 2016 public offering of common stock net of underwriter fees 9954 million of proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments and 7697 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings the net proceeds from issuances of debt consisted primarily of 8340 million of net borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit agreement and 3900 million of borrowings under the vehicle leasebacked loan and security agreement entered into in 2016 partially offset by settlements of 4547 million for certain conversions of the convertible senior notes due in 2018 furthermore we received 1803 million of net proceeds from fund investors

cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31 2015 consisted primarily of 7300 million from our august 2015 public offering of common stock and 5687 million of net proceeds from collateralized lease borrowings

 

 

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing and corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts the following table sets forth as of december 31 2017 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands

 

 



 





the table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits of 1910 million because if recognized they would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets

offbalance sheet arrangements

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2016 highlights

our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles as well as provide energy storage through the offering of powerpack and powerwall in addition through our acquisition of solarcity corporation we also provide solar energy systems to residential and commercial customers  

as a result of our acquisition of solarcity we have reclassified the presentation of our historic energy storage products revenue and cost of revenue from services and other to energy generation and storage 

 

automotive

we produce and sell our model s sedan and our model x sport utility vehicle we continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with allwheel drive capability autopilot options internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates starting in the fourth quarter of 2016 we introduced second generation of autopilot which has improved hardware and enhanced functionalities including better safety and performance 

in 2016 our production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies during 2016 our production volume increased by 64 yearoveryear 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began delivering model x sport utility vehicle in 2016 we greatly ramped the production and deliveries of model x also in the first quarter of 2016 we unveiled model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which received significant interest to date we have substantially completed the design and prototypes of model 3 and are projecting to start production and deliveries in the second half of 2017 

 

energy generation and storage 

through our acquisition of solarcity corporation or solarcity on november 21 2016 we lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy to our customers typically at prices below utility rates  our longterm agreements with our customers generate a predictable and reliable stream of cash flows the operating results of solarcity from the acquisition date of november 21 2016 through december 31 2016 are included in our consolidated statements of operations also in 2016 we introduced solar roof  which we plan to begin selling and installing later in 2017 

in addition to solar energy systems we also sell energy storage products which consists of the powerwall for residential applications and the powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications in 2016 we completed several of our gridscale energy storage projects including the southern california edison mira loma substation and the american samoa island installation 

 

 

management opportunities challenges and risks and 2017 outlook

automotive demand production and deliveries 

during 2016 we improved our existing model s sedan and model x sport utility vehicle by introducing new variants that improve range performance safety and value we introduced several new features including updating the front fascia of model s in the second quarter of 2016 to expanding offerings of our battery size to cater to a wider range of consumers we expect to introduce further new vehicle variants and overtheairfunctionality over time we also expect that the demand for our vehicles will continue to increase as we improve our vehicles and expand our retail service and charging infrastructure and as we develop new products in addition the introduction of model 3 would also generate incremental demand by offering a less expensive alternative 

during the third quarter of 2016 we discontinued our resale value guarantee program in north america the resale value guarantee was originally introduced in 2013 to help to reassure customers that tesla vehicles would retain value over time 

we continue to make progress in increasing vehicle production for the year ended december 31 2016 we produced approximately 84000 vehicles an increase of 64 from the prior year this increase was achieved despite the fact that we faced challenges in 2016 with model x production including part shortages in january 2017 we completed the acquisition of grohmann engineering gmbh a german manufacturing company with expertise in automated production we expect this acquisition will facilitate and expand vehicle production 

 

 

in the first quarter of 2016 we announced our target to increase overall vehicle production level to 500000 vehicles in 2018 increasing production will require additional capital we have started the installation of model 3 manufacturing equipment in fremont and at gigafactory 1 and we are on track to support volume production and deliveries in the second half of 2017 

in addition to expanding our vehicle production and deliveries we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters due to economies of scale material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing the decreasing trend in cost of manufacturing vehicles is expected to improve total automotive gross margin over time and mitigate some of the higher ramp up costs associated with the launch of model 3 we have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control over utilization and minimization of scrapping materials this is also evident through increased product reliability including vehicle battery and drive units that resulted in a reduction of our warranty expense in addition we expect that the acquisition of grohmann will further increase our production automation and efficiency 

in order to accommodate a much larger fleet of customer vehicles as we increase deliveries and to provide timely customer service we are expanding our sales service and charging infrastructure worldwide in particular we continue to open new tesla retail and service locations around the world as of december 31 2016 we had a total of 265 sales and service locations and expect our longterm vehicle sales outside of north america to be over half of our worldwide total automotive revenue as we have less experience in international markets we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans with respect to timing and expected sales 

energy generation and storage demand 

we believe that demand for our energy products will continue to increase we plan to reduce customer acquisition costs by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling solar products in tesla stores in the fourth quarter of 2016 we revealed the solar roof product of which we expect to begin production and installation later in 2017 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2016 we also announced our second generation energy storage products powerpack 2 and powerwall 2 which offer significant price advantage per kwh and higher energy density 

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses 

 

we plan to build 500000 vehicles in 2018 given this plan we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures our capital expenditure needs include expenditures for the tooling production equipment and construction of the model 3 production lines equipment to support cell production at the gigafactory 1 as well as new retail locations service centers and supercharger locations we expect to invest between 20 billion and 25 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of model 3 production in 2017 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the net book value of our supercharger network was 2072 million and 1666 million respectively and as of december 31 2016 our supercharger network included 790 locations globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to continue to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2017 we expect that this investment will grow our supercharger network greatly we allocate supercharger related expenses to cost of total automotive revenues and selling general and administrative expenses these costs were immaterial for all periods presented

we expect operating expenses to grow in 2017 driven by engineering design and testing expenses related to model 3 supplier contracts and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence in addition we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of the increased selling general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage segment we expect selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 

automotive financing options

we offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions during 2016 we discontinued the resale value guarantee in north america but continue to offer it in selected european and asian markets resale value guarantees available for exercise during fiscal year 2017 total 1795 million in value

 

 

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially 

we currently offer vehicle leases in the us directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity as well as through a leasing partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in 39 states and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangements through our entities in canada germany and the uk leasing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our nearterm operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting in addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities but not for those offered through our leasing partner we only receive a limited portion of cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers to the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flow could be negatively impacted 

energy generation and storage financing options

 

through solarcity we offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system installed by us we enter into a standard solar energy system sale agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with one of the thirdparty lenders who finances the full purchase price we are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan if we are unable to continue to offer thirdparty financing or other financing alternatives to our customers on competitive terms our growth may slow and our financial and operating results may be adversely impacted

gigafactory 1 and manufacturing

we are developing gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules and battery packs in one location for both vehicles and energy storage products we broke ground on gigafactory 1 in june 2014 began assembling our energy storage products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015 and began production of lithiumion battery cells for our energy storage products in the first quarter of 2017  we continue to invest in construction of the building at gigafactory and in production equipment for battery module and pack production 

panasonic has agreed to partner with us on gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 at negotiated prices as these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within asc 840 leases  we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in early 2017 this will result in us recording the value of such assets within property plant and equipment net in our consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations for all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory 1 we will record the value of such assets on our consolidated balance sheet based on our current assessment as of december 31 2016 approximately 300 million is expected to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet during the first quarter of 2017

although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 1 given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate in addition we continue to expand production capacity at our fremont factory and are exploring additional production capacity in asia and europe  

 

 

gigafactory 2 and manufacturing 

through our acquisition of solarcity we have an agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york for the construction of an approximately 1 million square foot manufacturing facility capable of producing 1 gigawatt of solar panels annually on an approximately 8824 acre site located in buffalo new york referred to as gigafactory 2 in december 2016 we entered into a production pricing agreement phases 13 the phase 13 agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic corporation of north america and sanyo electronic co ltd collectively panasonic this agreement provides that panasonic will manufacture custom photovoltaic pv cells and modules for us primarily at gigafactory 2 and that we will purchase certain amounts of pv cells and modules form panasonic during the 10year term with the intent to produce pv cells and modules totaling approximately 1 gigawatt annually beginning in 2019 

the terms of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york among other things require us to comply with a number of covenants during the term of the agreement any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

automotive segment

automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity free access to our supercharger network and free future over the air software updates these deliverables are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period if we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar options and other information which may be available

starting in the third quarter of 2016 we started to separately present automotive leasing revenue and related cost of revenue all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees see “vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee” “vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “direct vehicle leasing program” for further details

services and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans and merchandise sales of preowned tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of nontesla vehicle tradeins

 

 

vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee 

we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners subsequent to june 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a determined resale value guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period

in cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive leasing revenue in cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to preowned vehicle inventory as of december 31 2016 1795 million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee

we also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners as we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under accounting standards codification asc 840  leases  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to leased vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets and record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue the maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program assuming we repurchase of all vehicles under this program is 8559 million at december 31 2016

as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we had 118 billion and 5275 million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and 2891 million and 1205 million recorded in deferred revenue liability

at least annually we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be significant changes to their estimated values

direct vehicle leasing program

we offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the north america and europe qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for up to 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had deferred 672 million and 258 million of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the individual leases

 

 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods

energy generation and storage segment

for solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price either directly or through the solar loan program revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met in instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as work in progress in our consolidated balance sheets however any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against solar energy systems and components sales revenue in accordance with asc 60550 customer payments and incentives  revenue for energy storage product sale is recognized when the product is delivered or installed provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

for revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems including energy storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met for incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system we record revenue as the amounts are earned the difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets

for solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under power purchase agreements we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for in substance as operating leases pursuant to asc 840 revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met

we capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or power purchase agreements the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased – net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or power purchase agreement 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis in addition cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy generation and storage products we sell at the time of delivery we accrue for a manufacturer’s warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future for the solar energy systems that we sell we provide a warranty on the installation and components for periods typically between 10 to 30 years the manufacturer’s warranty on the solar energy systems’ components which is typically passedthrough to customers ranges from 5 to 30 years the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as a current liability 

our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles and solar energy systems accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements any costs to repair these vehicles and systems are expensed as incurred warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue for automotive related sale and cost of energy generation and storage revenue for solar energy and storage systems

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 5274901 stock options to our ceo the “2012 ceo grant” the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date 

each of the ten vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant 

the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met

 

 

as of december 31 2016 the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our board of directors and therefore five of ten tranches of the 2012 ceo grant were vested as of such date 











as of december 31 2016 the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement









we expect that the next performance milestone to be achieved will be the successful completion of the model 3 beta prototype which would be achieved upon the determination by our board of directors that an eligible prototype has been completed candidates for such prototype are among the vehicles that we are currently building as part of our ongoing testing of our model 3 vehicle design and manufacturing processes

as the above four performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 158 million 106 million and 250 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

additionally no cash compensation has ever been received by our ceo for his services to the company

income taxes 

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states and in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2016 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

 

 

principles of consolidation 

our consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board or fasb asc 810 consolidation  we consolidate any variable interest entity or vie of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems the typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as vies through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests asc 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a vie if that party has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate a vie in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of vies we evaluate our relationships with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that solarcity enters into to finance the costs of solar energy systems under operating leases we have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on our consolidated balance sheets as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries under the hlbv method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and distributed to the thirdparties the thirdparties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in our consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of our consolidated balance sheets since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets

business combinations

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill the excess of the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities over the fair value of purchase consideration is recorded as gain from bargain purchase in other income and expense net in our consolidated statements of operations when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and certain tangible assets such as solar energy systems acquired as part of our solarcity acquisition

critical estimates in valuing certain tangible and intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

revenues 

 



 

automotive segment

automotive revenue includes revenues related to sale of new model s and model x vehicles including internet connectivity supercharger access and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for model s and model x vehicles sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting 

services and other revenue consists of sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers maintenance services and sales of preowned vehicles 

2016 compared to 2015

automotive revenue increased 216 billion or 63 to 559 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily related to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries to approximately 50700 the increase in volume is primarily due to a full year of model x deliveries in 2016 as well as increased production and sales of model s further there was an overall increase in average selling price of 61 primarily due to the introduction of model x which are higher priced vehicles compared to model s in addition there is an increase of 1334 million to 3023 million of the sale of regulatory credits from the year ended december 31 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016 these increases were partially offset by negative impact from the movement of foreign currency exchange rates 

automotive leasing revenue increased 4524 million or 146 to 7618 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 1126 million in automotive leasing revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees

service and other revenue increased 1774 million or 61 to 4680 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to an increase of 1174 million in preowned vehicle sales as we received more tradeins and an increase in maintenance service revenue of 666 million as our fleet continues to grow

energy generation and storage revenue increased 1669 million or 1153 primarily due to 841 million as a result of the inclusion of revenue from solarcity from the acquisition date of november 21 2016 through december 31 2016 as well as an increase of 828 million in energy storage revenue as we ramped up our energy storage sales effort and completed several utility scale projects such as southern california edison mira loma substation  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 



 

automotive segment

cost of automotive revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand 

cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and energy products costs associated with providing maintenance services  and costs to acquire and certify preowned vehicles

2016 compared to 2015

cost of automotive revenues increased 163 billion or 62 to 427 billion during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a full year of model x deliveries as well as increased deliveries for model s in addition the increase is due to product mix as model x has a higher cost structure than model s the increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of 200 million resulting from better vehicle reliability 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2986 million or 163 to 4820 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended december 31 2015 to the year ended december 31 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized 1143 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees

gross profit for the automotive segment increased from 9213 million for the year ended december 31 2015 to 160 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 automotive gross margin increased from 229 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 234 for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we further improve our production processes partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance 

2015 compared to 2014

cost of automotive revenues increased 5816 million or 28 to 264 billion during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in cost of automotive revenues was driven primarily by increased model s deliveries 

cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 960 million or 110 to 1834 million during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase is primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees as volume of model s increased 

for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 costs of services and other revenue were 2869 million and 1669 million the increase in cost of services and other revenues was driven primarily by greater preowned vehicle sales and increased maintenance and repair services

gross profit for the automotive segment increased from 8815 million from the year ended december 31 2014 to 9213 million for the year ended december 31 2015 gross margin for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 were 229 and 276 the lower margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to product and regional mix shift as a greater percentage of sales were derived from vehicle models with lower average selling prices and increased manufacturing costs related to the ramp in production of the small drive unit for dual motor model s vehicles and start of model x production obsolete inventory and lower zev credits revenue this margin decrease was partially offset by an increasing amount of revenues from vehicles accounted for as leases including direct lease vehicles and those under our resale value guarantee programs which have a significantly higher gross margin and from material cost savings services and other gross margin were also down year over year primarily driven by a planned price reduction for powertrain sales to daimler

energy generation and storage segment

cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs overhead of solar energy systems and energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems 

cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased 1660 million to 1783 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is due to an increase of 670 million as a result of the inclusion of solarcity’s financial results from the acquisition date of november 21 2016 to december 31 2016 the remaining increase was due to increase in the sale of energy storage products and increased expenditures to increase the capacity of energy storage products

other income expense net 

 



 

  less than 1

 

 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates additionally other income expense net includes a gain from the acquisition of solarcity for the year ended december 31 2016 

other income net was 1113 million in the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to other expense net of 417 million during the same period in 2015 representing increases of 1529 million during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a gain from the acquisition of solarcity of 887 million and a loss on conversion of our 2018 notes of 72 million the remainder of the change in other income expense net was primarily result of fluctuations in gains losses from foreign currency exchange

other expense was 417 million in the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to an income of 18 million during the same period in 2014 fluctuations in other income expense from 2014 to 2015 are primarily the result of gains losses from foreign currency exchange of 456 million and 20 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 foreign currency losses during 2015 related primarily to changes in the exchange rates of euro norwegian krone canadian dollars and chinese yuan

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 was 267 million 130 million and 94 million the increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests

 

the net loss allocation to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2016 was 981 million and was related to solarcity’s financing arrangements

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity

 

as of december 31 2016 we had 339 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents which included 22 billion of money market funds this balance included 9690 million drawn under our asset based line of credit and 3900 million drawn under our warehouse agreement which we entered into in august 2016 to support the tesla finance direct leasing program in addition the balance included 2135 million of cash assumed as part of the solarcity acquisition amounts held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 8271 million as of december 31 2016 and consisted primarily of euro chinese yuan and canadian dollars

 

sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles proceeds from retail financing activities and sales of energy generation and storage products in addition through our acquisition of solarcity we expect to generate additional liquidity through the sale of solar energy systems to customers and financing funds created to monetize the cash flows tax attributes and other incentives generated by solar energy systems deployed under operating leases or power purchase agreements we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months based on our current plans we may raise funds in the future including through potential equity or debt offerings subject to market conditions and recognizing that we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms or at all the amount and timing of funds that we may raise is undetermined and will vary based on a number of factors including our liquidity needs as well as access to current and future sources of liquidity 

 

 

these current sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations and research and development projects the initial investments in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned model 3 the continued construction of gigafactory 1 and the expansion of our retail stores service centers and supercharger network we are planning to produce 500000 total vehicles in 2018 which is approximately double our prior growth plan we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs we expect to invest between 20 billion and 25 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of model 3 production in 2017 

 

 

 

as part of the solarcity acquisition we have an agreement to spend or incur approximately 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of new york during the 10year period following full production at gigafactory 2 we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at gigafactory 2 and other operations within the state of new york over the 10year term of the agreement and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default 

 

capital resources

 

as of december 31 2016 we have the following credit facilities available 

 





 

 

in addition as a result of the acquisition of solarcity additional credit facilities are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 solarcity has financing fund commitments from several fund investors that can be drawn in the future upon the achievement of specific funding criteria as of december 31 2016 solarcity had entered into 63 financing funds that had a total of 4814 million of undrawn committed capital

we are currently producing and selling both the model s sedan and the model x sport utility vehicle we have broadened the appeal of model s by introducing new variants that improve range performance and value for those wanting a more affordable car we introduced model s 70 with a starting price of only 70000 before incentives and fuel savings our new 90kwh battery pack option enables almost 300 miles of range at 65 mph finally for our performance enthusiasts the new ludicrous mode option improves 0 to 60 mph acceleration to 28 seconds the introduction of model x now provides customers with a performance electric vehicle option in the sport utility segment for the first time similar to model s we expect to introduce new versions and functionality for the model x over time overall we expect that demand for our vehicles will continue to increase worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles as we grow our customer sales and service infrastructure and as we continue to develop our products 

we have been increasing our production activities and expect to continue to do so in august 2014 we began a significant production capacity increase at the tesla factory by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center these production capacity increases continued into 2015 with further investments including building a new paint shop a new body shop for model x and additional stamping capacity we expect our annual production will increase considerably each year for the next several years in addition scaling our deliveries means that we will have an increasing number of cars intransit therefore production will exceed deliveries 

during 2015 we achieved significant efficiencies in model s production and produced 14037 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began production of model x in the third quarter of 2015 we plan to deliver 80000 to 90000 new model s and model x vehicles in 2016

in addition to expanding our vehicle production we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters we expect that this trend will contribute to improved au tomotive gross margin over time excluding the impact of foreign currency movements significant cost improvements for model s were achieved in 2014 and 2015 relating to material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and manufacturing efficiencies excluding the impact of newly introduced model s variants and model x however during our product introductions over the last few years we incurred ma nufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin we expect that automotive gross margin should increase during 2016 due to cost reductions for model s and improving margin on model x as our manufacturing effici ency improves for that v ehicle supporting our plan to be profitable for the fourth quarter of 2016 i f we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or ramp model x efficiently our ability to reach our g ross margin goals would be negatively affected in the shortterm 

to support our planned vehicle growth in 2016 we plan to continue expanding stores and service infrastructure worldwide provide more timely service in areas with a high concentration of tesla customers and continue expanding our supercharger and destination charger network since we now offer our vehicles in many countries throughout north america europe and asia our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence we expect our longterm sales outside of north america will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue as compared to markets in the united states we have relatively limited experience in international markets and thus we may face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans if we experience unexpected difficulties or delays in finding and opening desirable locations for stores and service centers we may not be able to meet our delivery plans

trends in cash flow capital expenditures and operating expenses 

we expect to see a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the fullyear 2016 we plan to fund about 15 billion in capital expenditures without accessing any outside capital other than our existing sources that support our leasing and finished goods inventory we plan to invest in equipment to support cell production at the gigafactory begin installation of model 3 vehicle production machinery open about 80 retail locations and service centers and energize about 300 new supercharger locations

our operating expenses are expected to grow by about 20 in 2016 as compared to 2015 driven primarily by the expansion of our retail and service centers as well as increases in general and administrative costs to support the growth of the business we expect sales general and administrative expenses to decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 

as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the net book value of our supercharger network was 3392 million and 1078 million and as of december 31 2015 included 584 locations globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2016 during 2016 this investment will grow our supercharger network by about 50 we allocate supercharger related expenses to cost of automotive revenues and selling general and administrative expenses these costs were immaterial for all periods presented

customer financing options 

we offer loans and leases in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions we offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and as of december 31 2015 had approximately 18400 vehicles under this program we expanded this program to selected european and asian markets during the first half of 2015 resale value guarantees available for exercise within the next 12 months total 1368 million in value and relate to 3017 vehicles

vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes 

while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows alternatively in cases where customers retain their vehicles past the expiration of the guarantee period the remaining deferred revenues and costs will be recognized at no gross profit 

based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially 

we currently offer leases in the u s directly from our captive financing entity as well as through a leasing partner leasing through tesl a finance is now available in 39 states and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangements through e ntities in canada germany and uk as of december 3 1  2015 we ha d leased approximately 3 660 vehicles throu gh our captive financing entities in the us and germany and approximately 673 0 vehicles through our leasing partner le asing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our nearterm operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting in addition for leas es off ered directly from our captive financing entities but not for those offered through our bank partner we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expand ing our leasing offerings 

the gigafactory 

we are developing the gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules and battery packs in one location we broke ground on the gigafactory in june 2014 and began assembling our tesla energy products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015 we currently expect to produce cells at this site beginning in 2016 for use initially in our tesla energy products and later for our vehicles over the next few years we will continue to invest in the expansion of additional tesla energy production capacity 

we continue to invest in construction of the building and utilities at the gigafactory and in production equipment for battery module and pack production we will be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory and will engage with partners who have significant experience in battery cell and material production panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices as these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within asc 840 – leases  we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in 2016

given the size and complexity of this undertaking the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectations we may have difficulty signing up additional partners and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

vehicle sales include standard features customer selected options and accessories and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity access to our supercharger network and future over the air software updates these deliverables are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period if we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar options and other information which may be available

vehicle sales to customers with a residual value guarantee 

we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified banking partners under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a predetermined resale value guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these as operating leases the amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the stated guarantee period the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicles to leased vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive revenue over the same period

in cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue in cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to preowned vehicle inventory as of december 31 2015 1368 million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve months

vehicle sales to leasing partners with a residual value guarantee

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we also began offering residual value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners as we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under asc 840  leases  under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicles under this program to leased vehicles on our consolidated balance sheets and record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows

at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the residual value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive revenue in cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive revenue the maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program assuming we repurchase of all vehicles under this program is 3482 million at december 31 2015

as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we had 5275 million and 167 million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and 1205 million and 39 million recorded in deferred revenue liability

at least annually we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be significant changes to their estimated values

direct vehicle leasing program

we offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the united states canada and germany qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from tesla for 36 or 48 months at the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we had deferred 258 million and 94 million of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the individual leases lease revenues are recorded in automotive revenue and for the year ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we recognized 412 million and 44 million

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicl e limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles production powertrain components and systems and tesla energy products we sell at the time of delivery we accrue for a manufacturer’s warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as a current liability 

our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements costs to repair these vehicles are expensed as incurred warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 527 4901 stock options to our ceo 2012 ceo grant the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service t o us through each vesting date 

each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant





















the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met

as of december 31 2015 the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our board of directors and therefore four of ten tranches of the 2012 ceo grant were vested as of such date 









as of december 31 2015 the following two performance milestones were considered probable of achievement





as the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 106 million 250 million and 145 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

additionally no cash compensation has ever been received by our ceo for his services to the company

income taxes 

we are subject to federal and state taxes in the united states in many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us many countries in the european union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard as of december 31 2015 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize th e effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those po sitions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such j urisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we s till have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

 

 

results of operations 

revenues 

automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new model s and model x vehicles including internet connectivity supercharging access and over the air software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees and vehicle leasing revenue 

services and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans and merchandise sales of preowned tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers tesla energy products and net sales of nontesla vehicle tradeins 

automotive revenue during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 374 billion 300 billion and 192 billion the increase was primarily driven by the ramp in vehicle deliveries for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 automotive revenue includes 3094 million 1326 million and 335 million from the accretion of the deferred revenues from our resale value guarantee and other similar programs as well as tesla leasing 

service and other revenue during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 3050 million 1913 million and 916 million related primarily to increases in preowned vehicle sales and maintenance service revenue in all years and increased powertrain sales in 2014 as compared to 2013

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of automotive revenues includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs vehicle internet connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for onhand inventory that is either obsolete or is in excess of forecasted demand

cost of automotive revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 282 billion 215 billion and 148 billion the increase in cost of automotive revenues was driven primarily by increased model s deliveries for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized 1724 million 845 and 211 million in cost of automotive revenues related to cars accounted for as operating leases 

cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs for repair and maintenance services allocations of service center overhead costs preowned tesla vehicle sales sales of our powertrain components and costs related to the production and sale of tesla energy products for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 costs of services and other revenue were 2992 million 1709 million and 739 million the increase in cost of services and other revenues was driven primarily by greater preowned vehicle sales and increased maintenance and repair services in all years and increased powertrain sales to daimler in 2014 as compared to 2013 

gross profit for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 9235 million 8817 million and 4563 million gross ma rgin for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 228 276 and 227 the lower margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to product and regional mix shift as a greater percentage of sales were derived from vehicle models wit h lower average selling prices and increased manufacturing costs related to the ramp in production of the small drive unit for dual motor model s vehicles and start of model x production  obsolete inventory and lower zev credits revenue this margin decre ase was partially offset by an increasing amount of revenues from vehicles accounted for as leases including direct lease vehicles and those under our resale value guarantee programs which have a significantly higher gross margin and from material cost sav ings services and other gross margin were also down year over year primarily driven by a planned price reduction for powertrain sales to daimler the increase in gross profit from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to manufacturing and supply chain efficien cies as well as component cost reductions and higher regulatory credit sales partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and launch of allwheel drive dual motor model s 

research and development expenses 

research and development rd expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense

interest expense 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was 1189 million 1009 million and 329 million the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the issuance of 9200 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 notes and 138 billion aggregate principal amount of 2021 notes during the first half of 2014 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and the change in the fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates prior to the expiration of the doe warrant in may 2013 the doe warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income expense net 

other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was 417 million 18 million and 226 million fluctuations in other income expense from 2014 to 2015 are primarily the result of gains losses from foreign currency exchange of 456 million and 20 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 foreign currency losses during 2015 related primarily to changes in the exchange rates of euro norwegian krone canadian dollars and chinese yuan other income net of 226 million in 2013 was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability of 107 million during the year other income net also includes the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 especially related to the japanese yen 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was 130 million 94 million and 26 million the increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2015 we had 120 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including 2978 million of money market funds amounts held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 5356 million as of december 31 2015 and consisted primarily of euro danish krone norwegian krone swedish krone canadian dollars euro and japanese yen

sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles as well as customer deposits sales of regulatory credits proceeds from financing activities tesla energy products and repair and maintenance services we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over the next 12 months based on our current plans these cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations research and development projects for our planned model 3 and certain other future products purchase tooling and manufacturing equipment required to continue to ramp up production of model x and model s construct our gigafactory and establish and expand our retail stores service centers and supercharger network we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of about 15 billion in 2016

in 2015 we entered into a senior secured assetbased revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks under which we currently have total commitments of up to 1 billion the credit agreement provides for a senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility which we may draw upon as needed subject to certain conditions borrowed funds bear interest at the company’s option at an annual rate of a 1 plus libor or b the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 050 ii the lenders “prime rate” or iii 1 plus libor in february 2016 we amended the credit agreement and increased the availability and the commitments under the credit agreement from 7500 million to 10 billion as of december 31 2015 borrowings under the credit facility of 1350 million were used to repay all borrowings under and terminate a secured asset based line of credit we used to support our direct leasing program

when market conditions are favorable we may evaluate alternatives to pursue liquidity options to fund capital intensive initiatives should prevailing economic financial business or other factors adversely affect our ability to meet our operating cash requirements we could be required to obtain funding though traditional or alternative sources of financing we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

our operating cash inflows include cash from sales of our vehicles customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems these cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating leases and interest expense on our financings 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 5245 million 573 million and 2648 in 2015 2014 and 2013 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to an increase in overall inventory to support growth and increase in operating lease vehicles partially offset by proceeds from sales and higher operating expenses in rd and sga 

the decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to an increase in finished goods inventory primarily due to cars whose delivery slipped from q4 of 2014 to the following year an increase in raw material inventory balances at year end necessary to meet our planned production requirements for model s in q1 of the following year higher operating expenses in rd and sga and use of cash for vehicles directly leased by us partially offset by increased cash receipts from customer payments on vehicle sales including an increase in customer deposits

customer deposits 

we collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and in some locations at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery customer deposits are fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery as of december 31 2015 we held 2834 million in customer deposits 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations including investments in model s manufacturing equipment and tooling and our stores service centers and supercharger network infrastructure cash used in investing activities was 167 billion 9904 million and 2494 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 cash flows from investing activities and variability between each year related primarily to capital expenditures which were 163 billion 9699 million and 2642 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 expenditures in all years consisted primarily of purchases of capital equipment tooling and facilities to support our model s and model x manufacturing 

in 2014 we began construction of our gigafactory facility in nevada tesla’s contribution to total capital expenditures are expected to be about 20 billion over the next 5 years in 2015 we used cash of 2200 million towards the construction of the first stage of this project and expect to spend up to 250 million over the next 12 months 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 152 billion 214 billion and 6354 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 cash flows from financing activities during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 consisted primarily of 7383 million net proceeds from august 2015 public offering of 3099173 shares of common stock and 5687 received from vehicle sales to our bank leasing partners the decrease in cash provided from financing in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to 21 billion net proceeds received in 2014 from issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes 

the increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to 21 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes including the associated hedge and warrant transactions representing a 15 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013 cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of 4150 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and 4523 million used to repay our doe loans

025 and 125 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in 2014 we issued 9200 million principal amount of 025 convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 138 billion principal amount of 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes in a public offering the total net proceeds from these offerings after deducting transaction costs were approximately 9058 million from the 2019 notes and 136 billion from the 2021 notes the interest rates are fixed at 025 and 125 per annum for the 2019 and 2021 notes and are payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year commencing on september 1 2014 

in connection with the offering of these notes in 2014 we purchased convertible note hedges for 6034 million in aggregate and sold warrants for 3892 million in aggregate taken together the pur chase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 notes and 2021 notes 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130 of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 notes and 2021 notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter furthermore no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of december 31 2015 therefore the 2019 notes and 2021 notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2016 and are classified as longterm debt should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter the 2019 notes andor the 2021 notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter 

150 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes in a public offering the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million the interest under the notes is fixed at 150 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 

in connection with the offering of the 2018 notes we purchased convertible note hedges for 1775 million in aggregate and sold warrants for 1203 million in aggregate taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 notes

during the fourth quarter of 2015 the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter therefore holders of 2018 notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2016 as such we classified the 6177 million carrying value of our 2018 notes as current liabilities and classified 421 million representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 notes of 6598 million and the carrying value of 2018 notes as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 similarly debt issuance costs were classified as other current assets as of december 31 2015 should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter the 2018 notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter

common stock offering and concurrent private placement 

concurrent with the execution of the 2018 notes and related transactions in may 2013 we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3902862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately 3551 million which includes 487857 shares or 450 million sold to our chief executive officer ceo net of underwriting discounts and offering costs we also sold 596272 shares of our common stock to our ceo and received total cash proceeds of 550 million in a private placement at the public offering price 

in august 2015 we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3099173 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately 7383 million which includes 82645 shares or 200 million sold to elon musk our chief executive officer ceo net of underwriting discounts and offering costs 

contractual obligations 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing and corporate offices these also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts we have the following contractual obligations including firm purchase obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the table below were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part at our discretion and are therefore not considered firm purchase obligations

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2015 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 



 







offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2014 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and stationary energy storage applications we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model s sedan model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling the model s inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and have delivered 56768 vehicles through december 31 2014 we recently announced the availability of our allwheel drive dual motor model s and began delivery starting with a performanceoptimized version in december 2014 

we are continuing to develop our model x crossover vehicle and intend to commence customer deliveries in the third quarter of 2015 after the model x our goal is to introduce model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in 2017 

our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized total revenues of 320 billion an increase of 119 billion over total revenues of 201 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily driven by growth of model s deliveries worldwide 

gross margin for the year ended december 31 2014 was 276 a significant increase from 227 for the year ended december 31 2013 higher vehicle production volume supply chain efficiencies and component cost reductions partially offset by onetime manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and introduction of allwheel drive dual motor model s contributed to higher gross margin in 2014 

research and development rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 were 4647 million an increase from 2320 million for the year ended december 31 2013 rd expenses in 2014 reflected our engineering work on model x as well as development work on our dual motor powertrain and other development programs including localization efforts for foreign markets rd expenses in 2013 reflected our activities on manufacturing process improvements model s cost reductions the righthand drive model s and localization efforts for foreign markets as well as development work on model x 

during 2014 we significantly increased our sales and service footprint worldwide entered several new markets including china as well as accelerated the rollout of our supercharging network with the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure and the business in general in 2014 selling general and administrative expenses were 6037 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2856 million for the year ended december 31 2013 

 

 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

 

orders production and deliveries

our orders for model s in 2014 significantly increased from the prior year as we expanded our operations internationally and introduced model s product enhancements in october 2014 we revealed our allwheel drive dual motor model s and our autopilot system this version of model s proved very popular leading to over 10000 unfulfilled orders as of january 1 2015 we expect that demand for model s will continue to increase worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles as we grow our customer support infrastructure and as we broaden the appeal of our products

as of december 31 2014 we had received almost 20000 reservations for model x in advance of its planned introduction later this year we are continuing to test the beta model x prototypes and plan to begin building and testing a small fleet of release candidate model x vehicles later in the first quarter of 2015 our ability to launch the model x program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors including completion of production tooling supplier readiness engineering completion and the successful completion of our validation testing 

in order to meet this anticipated demand for both model s and model x we are executing a plan to increase our combined model s and model x production capacity to over 2000 units per week by the end of 2015 in august 2014 we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center we are planning further investments in production capacity during 2015 including building a new paint shop and a new body shop for model x we expect our annual production will increase by over 50 each year for the next several years 

 

our recent production capacity expansion contributed to several weeks of production in excess of 1000 vehicles per week during the last few months of 2014 however the changeover to our new final assembly line during the third quarter of 2014 and the introduction of allwheel drive dual motor model s onto this line during the fourth quarter of 2014 took longer than we expected consequently we delivered fewer vehicles than we had planned in 2014 during 2015 we plan to achieve significant efficiencies in model s production and begin production of model x with the intent of achieving a significantly faster initial production ramp than we achieved with model s any unexpected issues with the expansion of our production capacity or the launch and ramp of model x production could affect our ability to meet future delivery targets 

in addition to expanding our production we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles and improve our gross margin significant cost improvements for model s were achieved in 2013 and 2014 including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing efficiencies we expect that this trend will continue as we execute on our roadmap we expect that such improvements when combined with a favorable mix of vehicles will allow us to achieve a 30 gross margin on model s by the end of 2015 assuming no further deterioration in foreign currencies however we expect these cost improvements will be partially offset by production inefficiencies during the introduction of model x during our product introductions in 2014 we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin when we introduce model x we expect that both production inefficiencies and supply chain inefficiencies typical of a new product introduction will suppress model x margins for at least a few quarters after its introduction if we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or introduce model x efficiently our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected 

we expect to deliver approximately 55000 model s and x vehicles worldwide in 2015 approximately 74 more deliveries than we achieved in 2014 to support this growth we plan to continue to expand our supercharger stores and service infrastructure worldwide as well as to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of model s customers as we now offer model s in countries throughout north america europe and asia our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence based on our current projections we expect our longterm sales outside of north america will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sales despite initial challenges in china we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure in china as we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years however as compared to markets in the united states and europe we have relatively limited experience in asian markets thus we may face continuing difficulties meeting our future expansion plans in asia 

trends in capital expenditures and operating expenses

our capital expenditures and operating expenses significantly increased in 2014 as we continue to invest in the long term growth of tesla capital spending and operating expenses will continue to increase but at a more moderate pace than in 2014 during 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be about 15 billion as we expand production capacity complete model x development and invest in the gigafactory our stores and service centers we also plan to grow our supercharger network by over 50 this year as well as continue other product development programs including model 3 

our operating expenses will continue to grow in 2015 but at less than half the pace of growth in 2014 or approximately 45 to 50 annualized our rd expenses in particular will continue to increase as we complete the development validation and testing of model x and accelerate design and engineering work on model 3 growth of sales general and administrative expenses will be more modest as we will be particularly focused on increasing operational efficiency while we continue to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we expect overall operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the net book value of our supercharger network was 1078 million and 256 million and currently includes 380 locations globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to be approximately 5 of total capital spending over the next 12 months we allocate supercharger related expenses to cost of revenues automotive sales and selling general and administrative expenses these costs were immaterial for all periods presented  

customer financing options

we offer loans and leases in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institutions in 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and have since provided this guarantee to approximately 10400 model s customers model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenues and operating results as this and similar programs initially ramp up as time passes the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact furthermore while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin 

 

we currently offer leases in the us directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity as well as through a bank partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in 37 states the district of columbia and in 4 provinces of canada we leased approximately 1150 vehicles through tesla finance during 2014 and about approximately 200 vehicles through our banking partner leasing through both tesla finance and our banking partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our nearterm revenues and operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting in addition for leases offered directly from tesla finance but not for those offered through our bank partner we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we expect to increase our leasing activities during 2015

we have set the residual values given to our customers under our resale value guarantee program at what we estimate will be the tradein value of these vehicles at the end of the term of the option based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts should market values or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially 

 

the tesla gigafactory 

we are developing the tesla gigafactory a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in one location in june 2014 we broke ground on the gigafactory outside of reno nevada construction continued during the end of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to be produced in 2016 for use in model s and model x 

while our plan is to produce lithiumion cells and finished battery packs at the gigafactory our plans for such production are at a very early stage we have no experience in the production of lithiumion cells and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production we recently formalized our agreement with panasonic to partner on the gigafactory panasonic will invest in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells we will prepare and provide the land buildings and utilities for the gigafactory invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory we anticipate bringing on additional partners for the gigafactory to create a fully integrated industrial complex although planning discussions with production and supply chain partners continue to progress well to date we have not formalized any agreements with any other partners in addition the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits such as zev and greenhouse gas emission ghg credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including internet connectivity supercharging access and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware these deliverables are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the car or for software upgrades as they are delivered if we sell a derivable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options costs used to develop and deliver the service and other information which may be available 

 

resale value guarantee 

we offer a resale value guarantee program to customers who purchase a model s and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial banking partners in the us canada and europe under this program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period from 36 to 39 months after delivery for a specified value determined at time of purchase because we offer a resale value guarantee we account for these transactions as operating leases accordingly we recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straightline basis over the guarantee period to automotive sales revenue similarly we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period 

at the end of the guarantee period which is the earlier of 39 months or the payoff date of the initial loan the resale value guarantee and deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive sales revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive sales if our customer retains ownership of the car in cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39 we issue a check to the customer in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive sales revenue

at least annually we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program as we accumulate more data related to the resale values of model s there may be significant changes to their estimated values 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for model s which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery with either a fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of model s parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time for customers that are not covered by our new vehicle limited warranties or our extended service plans we offer tesla ranger service at a higher cost payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods 

we provided tesla roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles we refer to this program as our extended service plan amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the extended warranty period 

additionally we have previously provided customers of our tesla roadsters with a onetime option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles we refer to this program as our battery replacement program amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs 

inventory valuation 

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

 

warranties 

we provide a warranty on all vehicles production powertrain components and systems sales and we accrue warranty reserves upon delivery to customer warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty these estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed these estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities while the remaining amount is classified as longterm within other longterm liabilities during the third quarter of 2014 we extended the warranty on our model s drive unit to eight years from four and reassessed our overall powertrain and vehicle warranty reserves which resulted in an additional charge of approximately 140 million

our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our operating lease vehicles including those sold with resale value or similar guarantee terms in such cases actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a component of cost of revenues

valuation of stockbased awards 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 5274901 stock options to our ceo 2012 ceo grant the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date 

each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant











 











the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met

as of december 31 2014 the market conditions for six vesting tranches and the following performance milestone were achieved and approved by our board of directors 



as of december 31 2014 the following performance milestone was achieved and subject to our board of directors’ approval at the upcoming board meeting



as of december 31 2014 the following three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement







as the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 250 million 145 million and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

additionally no cash compensation has ever been received by our ceo for his services to the company

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2014 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

 

 

results of operations 

revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales which include vehicle options and related sales and powertrain component and related sales consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

 



 

vehicle options and related sales primarily represent revenues related to deliveries of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers 

vehicle options and related sales during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 308 billion 195 billion and 354 million the significant increases in vehicle options and related sales was primarily driven by the ramp in model s deliveries including the commencement of deliveries to europe in august 2013 and china in april 2014 deliveries of model s vehicles were 31655 in 2014 22477 in 2013 and 2636 in 2012 following the commencement of our model s deliveries in june 2012 the increase also resulted from higher sales of regulatory credits yearoveryear during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 regulatory credit sales were 2163 million 1944 million and 405 million

in april 2013 we launched our resale value guarantee program during the year ending december 31 2014 we delivered 5224 cars and recognized 1282 million revenue under this program during 2013 we delivered 5179 under this program and recognized 291 million of revenue as of december 31 2014 we recorded 3735 million in deferred revenues and 4879 million in resale value guarantee related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee as of december 31 2013 we recorded 2309 million in deferred revenues and 2363 million in resale value guarantee related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee

powertrain component and related sales for the periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to daimler under the mercedesbenz bclass electric drive program which commenced in april 2014 and to toyota under the rav4 ev program powertrain component and related sales for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 1133 million 451 million and 314 million during the third quarter of 2014 we completed the rav4 ev program 

 

development services 

development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automotive manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs drive units and chargers to meet customers’ specifications we provided development services to daimler and toyota to assist in the development of electric powertrains for the mercedes benz bclass ev and the toyota rav4 during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized revenue under these arrangement in the amounts of 56 million 157 million 276 million we do not expect any significant development services in future periods

beginning in the first quarter of 2015 we will change the caption of this to be services and other revenue this will include other revenues related to powertrain component sales to daimler and other oems vehicle service and sales from used model s cars

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services 

cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 231 billion 154 billion and 3717 million cost of automotive sales includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs royalty fees shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand and charges related to write down of fixed assets no longer in use for the production of model s or our powertrain component sales the increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by the ramp in model s deliveries 

in the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we recognized 661 million and 194 million respectively in cost of automotive sales related to vehicle depreciation for cars accounted for as operating leases for cars accounted for as leases our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 warranty costs incurred for our lease vehicles were 70 million and 16 million 

gross profit for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 8817 million 4563 million and 301 million gross margin for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 276 227 and 73 the increase in gross profit from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies as well as component cost reductions and higher regulatory credit sales partially offset by onetime manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and launch of allwheel drive dual motor model s the increase in gross profit from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher vehicle production volumes cost reduction efforts including process efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain design improvements as well as reduction of waste in the supply chain 

research and development expenses 

research and development rd expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in rd expenses also included in rd expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 were 4647 million an increase from 2320 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in rd expenses consisted primarily of an 853 million increase in employee compensation expenses a 607 million increase in expensed materials primarily to support our model x dual motor powertrain and righthand drive model s development a 509 million increase in costs related to model x dual motor powertrain and righthand drive model s engineering design and testing activities a 281 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to increased headcount and increasing values of awards granted a 41 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs and a 33 million increase in shipping charges for model x dual motor powertrain and righthand drive model s development

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2320 million a decrease from 2740 million for the year ended december 31 2012 rd expenses decreased due to significant development prototyping and testing expenses related to the model s launch in 2012 partially offset by an increase in similar costs in 2013 for model x and righthand drive model s and other programs the 420 million decrease in rd expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 consisted primarily of an 182 million decrease in expensed materials an 85 million decrease in employee compensation expenses a 78 million decrease in costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities a 66 million decrease in shipping charges for model s prototype materials and a 49 million decrease in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs the decrease was partially offset by a 50 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 were 6037 million an increase from 2856 million for the year ended december 31 2013 sga expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and costs to support an expanded retail service and supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business the 3181 million increase in our sga expenses consisted primarily of a 1411 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 1359 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence a 358 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to additional headcount and increasing value of awards granted and a 272 million increase in professional and outside services costs

other income expense net 

other income expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates prior to the expiration of the doe warrant in may 2013 the doe warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income expense net 

other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 18 million 226 million and 18 million the other income net of 226 million in 2013 was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability of 107 million during the year in march 2013 we entered into a fourth amendment to the doe loan facility which among other things accelerated the maturity date of our doe loans to december 15 2017 therefore the doe warrant was no longer expected to vest the other income net also includes the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 especially related to the japanese yen 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 94 million 26 million and 01 million the increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions following the commencement of european model s deliveries in august 2013 and model s deliveries in asia in april 2014 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2014 we had 191 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including 127 billion of money market funds amounts held in foreign currencies had a us dollar equivalent of 315 million as of december 31 2014 and consisted primarily of chinese yuan japanese yen euro and norwegian krone

sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of model s as well as customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over the next 12 months based on our current plans these cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations research and development projects for our planned model x model 3 and certain other future products purchase tooling and manufacturing equipment required to introduce model x and to continue to ramp up production of model s construct our gigafactory and establish and expand our stores service centers and supercharger network we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of about 15 billion over the next 12 months

when market conditions are favorable we may evaluate alternatives to pursue liquidity options to fund capital intensive initiatives should prevailing economic financial business or other factors adversely affect our ability to meet our operating cash requirements we could be required to obtain funding though traditional or alternative sources of financing we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

summary of cash flows

 



 

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

our operating cash inflows include cash from sales of our model s customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems these cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating leases and interest expense on our financings 

cash provided by used in operating activities was 573 million 2648 million and 2638 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to an increase in finished goods inventory primarily due to cars whose delivery slipped from q4 of 2014 to the following year an increase in raw material inventory balances at year end necessary to meet our planned production requirements for model s in q1 of the following year higher operating expenses in rd and sga and use of cash for vehicles directly leased by us partially offset by increased cash receipts from customer payments on vehicle sales including an increase in customer deposits

 

the increase in operating cash flows in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to an increase in cash receipts from customer payments on vehicles deliveries including for cars sold under our resale value guarantee program increased regulatory credits sold and increased customer deposits from orders for model s and x this was partially offset by an increase in inventory balances at yearend necessary to meet our planned production requirements for model s in q1 of the following year 

customer deposits 

we collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and in some locations at certain additional milestones up to the point of delivery customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery customer deposits related to model x still represent fully refundable reservations amounts are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery as of december 31 2014 we held 2576 million in customer deposits 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations including investments in model s manufacturing equipment and tooling and our stores service centers and supercharger network infrastructure cash used in investing activities was 9904 million 2494 million and 2069 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 cash flows from investing activities and variability between each year related primarily to capital expenditures which were 9699 million 2642 million and 2392 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 expenditures in all years consisted primarily of purchases of capital equipment tooling and facilities to support our model s and model x manufacturing 

in 2014 we began construction of our gigafactory facility in nevada tesla’s contribution to total capital expenditures are expected to be about 20 billion over the next 5 years in 2014 we used cash of 622 million towards the construction of the first stage of this project and expect to spend up to 300 million over the next 12 months 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 214 billion 6354 million and 4196 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in cash provided from financing in 2014 and compared to 2013 was primarily due to 21 billion net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 notes including the associated hedge and warrant transactions representing a 15 billion increase in debt financing as compared to 2013 cash flows from financing in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 included proceeds of 4150 million from the issuance of common stock in public and private offerings and 4523 million used to repay our doe loans

the increase in cash provided from financing in 2013 and compared to 2012 was primarily due to 5859 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2018 notes including the associated hedge and warrant transactions and a 1935 million increase in proceeds from public and private equity issuances in 2013 we used 4523 million to repay our doa loans as compared to proceeds of 1888 million received during 2012 under these loans 

025 and 125 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in 2014 we issued 9200 million principal amount of 025 convertible senior notes due 2019 2019 notes and 138 billion principal amount of 125 convertible senior notes due 2021 2021 notes in a public offering the total net proceeds from these offerings after deducting transaction costs were approximately 9058 million from 2019 notes and 136 billion from 2021 notes respectively the interest rates are fixed at 025 and 125 per annum for the 2019 and 2021 notes respectively and are payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year commencing on september 1 2014 

in connection with the offering of these notes in 2014 we purchased a convertible note hedges for 6034 million and sold warrants 3892 million taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2019 notes and 2021 notes 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130 of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 notes and 2021 notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter furthermore no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of december 31 2014 therefore the 2019 notes and 2021 notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2015 and are classified as longterm debt should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future quarter the notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter 

150 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes in a public offering the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million the interest under the notes is fixed at 150 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 

in connection with the offering of the 2018 notes we purchased a convertible note hedge for 1775 million and sold warrants for 1203 million taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 notes

 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter therefore holders of 2018 notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2015 upon conversion of 2018 notes we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of the converted notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted notes any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the notes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows business results of operations and financial condition should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future quarter 2018 notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter under current market conditions we do not expect the 2018 notes will be converted in the short term

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview and 2013 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model s sedan model s is a four door fivepassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling the model s inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster the tesla roadster was launched in 2008 and was the first commercially produced and federally compliant ev in the united states we commenced deliveries of model s in june 2012 and delivered 22477 vehicles in 2013 in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of our model x crossover vehicle we currently expect to have production design model x prototypes on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 

we sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network we are also building a network of superchargers in the united states europe and other international markets to allow model s owners to have the ability to travel long distances without a limitation on range by charging their cars at a very fast rate for free 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized total revenues of 201 billion an increase of 160 billion over total revenues of 4133 million for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily driven by the ramp up in model s deliveries which commenced in north america in june 2012 and the launch of european model s deliveries which commenced in august 2013 regulatory credit sales and powertrain component sales to toyota motor corporation toyota for the toyota rav4 ev partially offset by a decrease in development services activity related to the daimler ag daimler mercedesbenz bclass ev program 

gross margin for the year ended december 31 2013 was 227 a significant increase from 73 for the year ended december 31 2012 we experienced significant earlystage per unit cost inefficiencies during the production ramp of model s from june to december 2012 as a result of lower fixed cost absorption manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the initial production ramp and higher logistics costs as our supply chain processes were maturing we also had higher component prices as many vendors supplied parts at production prices later than planned due to their own manufacturing inefficiencies and production ramps as a result of higher vehicle production volume manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies and ongoing component cost reductions we achieved total and automotive gross margins of 255 and 257 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2013 regulatory credits sales higher average selling price due to the start of european signature series deliveries in august and a strong mix of 85 kwh battery packs and other options in all markets also contributed to higher gross margin in 2013 

research and development rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2320 million a decrease from 2740 million for the year ended december 31 2012 rd expenses in 2013 reflected our activities on manufacturing process improvements model s cost reductions the righthand drive model s and localization efforts for foreign markets as well as development work on model x rd expenses in 2012 included expenses related to our model s preproduction activities including manufacturing preparedness process validation prototype builds and extensive testing at both the vehicle and component levels development of the tesla factory development and testing of model s and other research and development activities until model s production started in the tesla factory in 2012 model s related manufacturing costs including labor costs manufacturing overhead and logistics were no longer captured in rd expenses but instead fully reflected in cost of automotive sales 

during 2013 we continued to expand our sales and service footprint both in north america and europe as well as opened our first store in china with the higher expenses associated with the global expansion of our 

  

customer infrastructure and the business in general including our information technology infrastructure selling general and administrative expenses were 2856 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1504 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

we ended the year with 8489 million in cash and cash equivalents and current restricted cash a significant increase from cash held at the end of 2012 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 notes the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million we incurred 120 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes which we recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the notes under the terms of the notes 150 coupon interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 approximately 450 million of the offering proceeds were used to repay all of our outstanding department of energy doe loan principal and interest including a 108 million early repayment fee 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately 12452 per share the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was 1775 million in addition we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase up to approximately 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of 18448 per share we received 1203 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 12452 to 18448 per share for more information on the notes convertible note hedge and warrant transactions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplemental data 

concurrent with the execution of the notes and related transactions we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3902862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately 3551 million which includes 487857 shares or 450 million sold to elon musk our chief executive officer and cofounder ceo net of underwriting discounts and offering costs we also sold 596272 shares of our common stock to our ceo and received total cash proceeds of 550 million in a private placement at the public offering price 

we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans however if market conditions are favorable we may evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we made significant progress in increasing production aided by manufacturing design and quality improvements but also through strong efforts from our supply chain we expect production to increase from 600 vehicles per week presently to about 1000 vehicles per week by the end of 2014 as we expand our factory capacity and address supplier bottlenecks battery cell supply will continue to constrain our production during the first half of 2014 but should significantly improve in the second half of the year as our cell supplier brings new production capacity online based on our higher production level we currently expect to deliver over 35000 model s vehicles in 2014 representing a more than 55 increase over 2013 

in 2013 model s was the top selling vehicle in north america among comparably priced vehicles nonetheless we believe there is room to improve in 2014 as we complete the supercharger network and expand the network of service centers in north america given the potential we see in europe and asia we expect sales in those regions combined to comprise almost twice that of north america by the end of 2014 

  

through the first half of 2013 we had delivered model s vehicles solely to customers in north america in august 2013 we started european deliveries of model s similar to the initial launch of model s in the united states and in canada we experienced an increase in our average selling price during the third quarter of 2013 due to the start of delivery of european signature series vehicles and a higher mix of 85 kwh vehicles and other options in all markets 

we intend to commence deliveries into china in the spring of 2014 we recently announced that the price for a model s in china will be the same as the price for a model s in the united states with the addition of only unavoidable taxes customs duties and transportation costs while we believe that this is consistent with our objective of offering transparent and fair pricing in every market this pricing strategy is counter to prevailing auto industry practices as such model s in china would be priced comparable to a midsized premium vehicle in china instead of a large luxury vehicle 

expansion into the right hand drive markets such as the united kingdom japan hong kong and australia will occur gradually over the year starting this spring we have not delivered model s vehicles outside of north america and europe in volume thus we may face difficulties meeting our delivery plans in asia and other right hand drive markets later this year which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a predetermined resale value we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee program similarly we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the amount of the resale value guarantee and operating lease vehicle net book value are then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales respectively 

the resale value guarantee amount represents management’s best estimate as to the resale value of the model s vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery we are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to expected salvage value of our operating lease vehicles at the end of their economic useful life ie the end of their expected operating lease term and we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the expected salvage value decreases in future periods as we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of model s we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates 

in 2013 we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 5200 model s deliveries in north america during the fourth quarter of 2013 we provided the resale value guarantee to approximately 40 of model s deliveries in north america we expect the penetration rate of the resale value guarantee to remain at the current level in the nearterm model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery however this program has adversely impacted our 2013 revenues and operating results by requiring the amortization of revenues and costs under lease accounting and will continue to adversely impact our future revenues and operating results based on the lease accounting treatment applied to this program furthermore while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles’ resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross margin 

in germany and other european markets we recently announced new leasing and financing options in collaboration with a number of global financial partners if customer interest in these options is significant we may be directly or indirectly subject to resale value risks for the model s we are currently evaluating a number of other customer financing products including direct small business leases as a way to better serve our growing customer base 

  

in addition to sales of model s we continue to recognize automotive sales from our supply of powertrain systems to toyota for the toyota rav4 ev however toyota is expected to end the current rav4 ev model this year 

in 2012 we began work on a full electric powertrain under the mercedesbenz bclass ev program and in 2013 we continued to provide development services and deliver prototype samples to daimler we currently expect to substantially complete our development services under this program in early 2014 and commence production of electric powertrains and battery packs shortly thereafter similar to our previous development services agreements due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of milestone revenues and the underlying costs of development services the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period 

we also plan to ramp up sales of stationary energy storage units for use in homes commercial sites and utilities the applications for these battery systems include backup power peak demand reduction demand response and wholesale electric market services however we have not yet entered into a significant number of agreements through december 31 2013 

significant production cost improvements for model s were achieved in 2013 including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing efficiencies we expect some of these trends to continue as we execute on our roadmap of achieving further component cost reductions and benefit from economies of scale we therefore expect our automotive gross margin to increase to about 28 in the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding potential zero emission vehicle zev credit sales and assuming a lower option take rate as we get to a more mainstream market and fewer people take the high performance options on model s if we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected 

in october 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic to among other things extend the term of the agreement by two years until december 31 2017 and provide for the longterm preferential prices and a minimum of 18 billion lithiumion battery cells that we will purchase from panasonic from 2014 through 2017 

we recognized 1298 million in zev credit sales in 2013 which contributed to our gross margin although zev credit revenue was strong for the year over 90 of zev credit sales were recognized during the first half of 2013 we expect the contribution of zev credit revenue to remain low in the future relative to our automotive sales as we continue to grow our sales outside the united states while we will pursue opportunities to monetize zev credits we earn from the sales of our vehicles we do not plan to rely on these sales to be a contributor to gross margin our business model and financial plan is not predicated on such zev credits other regulatory credit sales recognized during 2013 were 647 million 

in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we continue to work on the design and engineering work on model x and expect to have production design model x prototypes on the road by the end of 2014 and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015 our ability to launch the model x program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors including supplier readiness engineering completion and testing 

we continued to expand our stores and service infrastructure during 2013 in order to expand our geographical presence and to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of model s customers to help drive demand in new geographic areas we have also begun complementing our store strategy with sales capability within service centers to more rapidly and efficiently expand our retail footprint as of the end of the year we had stores galleries and service centers in over 110 locations around the world and plan to open many additional stores galleries and service centers in 2014 including growing rapidly in multiple regions in china we continue to build service infrastructure in advance of demand to ensure that aftersale services are available when and where needed and to help create further demand 

  

at the end of may 2013 we announced the significant expansion of our supercharger network as well as plans to reduce charging time at our superchargers since the time of our announcement we have been installing superchargers at an accelerating pace as of february 19 2014 we had 90 supercharger stations open and are continuing to expand our network in both north america and europe during 2014 we also intend to establish a supercharger network in china japan and hong kong if we experience difficulties in finding suitable sites negotiating leases or obtaining required permits for such locations our planned expansion of such superchargers could be delayed 

operating expense and capital expenditures are expected to significantly increase in absolute terms in 2014 as we plan to invest in the longterm growth of the company in 2014 we plan to significantly expand production capacity for model s and model x invest in our customer support infrastructure complete the development of model x and start early design work on our third generation vehicle which we refer to as “gen iii” our research and development expenses in particular are expected to increase as design and engineering work accelerates on model x our selling general and administrative expenses will continue to grow in absolute terms as we expand our customer and corporate infrastructure globally 

we have recently indicated our intention to build the tesla gigafactory a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in one location while we have not identified a final site for this facility we currently expect that it will be located in one of the following states arizona nevada new mexico or texas we currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1000 acres in size with up to approximately 10 million square feet of production space with one or two levels at full implementation the tesla gigafactory is expected to have 6500 dedicated tesla and production partner employees we currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the tesla gigafactory for our vehicles including the gen iii vehicle and stationary storage applications in approximately three years the tesla gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020 which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500000 vehicles annually and stationary storage applications 

we believe that the tesla gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30 on a per kwh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of gen iii the total capital expenditures associated with the tesla gigafactory through 2020 are expected to be 45 billion of which approximately 2 billion is expected to come from tesla 

while our plan is to attempt to produce lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for our gen iii vehicles at a new tesla gigafactory our plans for such production are at a very early stage we have no experience in the production of lithiumion cells and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell production and to date we have not formalized such partnerships in addition the cost of building and operating the tesla gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the tesla gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate 

during the third quarter of 2013 certain conditions with respect to the closing prices of our common stock in accordance with the terms of our notes were met and accordingly the notes were convertible at the holder’s option during the fourth quarter of 2013 although these conditions were not met during the fourth quarter of 2013 and therefore the notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 should such closing price conditions be met in a future quarter the notes will be convertible by their holders during the immediately following quarter upon conversion of the notes we will be obligated to pay cash for the principal amount of the converted notes and we may also have to deliver shares of our common stock in respect of such converted notes any conversion of the notes prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the notes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows business results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits such as zev and greenhouse gas emission ghg credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

model s revenue is generally recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers in certain circumstances we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer if the options do not limit the functionality of the vehicle in such cases we will continue to defer the related revenue based on the undelivered item’s fair value as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in standalone transactions where available or using the selling price hierarchy where such prices do not exist additionally if a customer purchases a vehicle option that requires us to provide services in the future we will defer the related revenue based on the undelivered items’ fair value and recognize the associated revenue over our expected performance period while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale they are often part of a single vehicle sales agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements 

for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available to date we have generally been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicle accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue we consider whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we also evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a standalone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items further we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items determined by reference to standalone sales of such items as each of these items has standalone value to the customer revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer 

  

resale value guarantee 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a predetermined resale value although we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases accordingly we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee program ie the proxy operating lease term similarly we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales over the same period if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the amount of the resale value guarantee and operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales respectively 

we estimated the expected residual value based on an evaluation of market indicators competitive factors as well as a third party valuation study we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed if the expected salvage value is projected to be lower in future periods as we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of model s we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates 

regulatory credit sales 

california and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles these laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements similar regulations exist at the federal level which require compliance related to ghg emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers as a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles we have earned regulatory credits such as zev and ghg credits on vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future since our commercial vehicles are electric we do not receive any compliance benefit from the generation of these credits and accordingly look to sell them to other vehicle manufacturers in order to facilitate the sale of these credits we enter into contractual agreements with third parties requiring them to purchase our regulatory credits at predetermined prices we recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the credits are transferred to the purchasing party by the governmental agency issuing these credits 

maintenance and service plans 

we offer a prepaid maintenance program for model s which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time the maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery with either a fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations 

we also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of model s parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time for customers that are not covered by our new vehicle limited warranties or our extended service plans we offer tesla ranger service at a higher cost payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods 

  

we provided tesla roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36000 miles we refer to this program as our extended service plan amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the extended warranty period 

additionally we have previously provided customers of our tesla roadsters with a onetime option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles we refer to this program as our battery replacement program amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs 

development services 

revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs drive units and sample vehicles to meet a customer’s specifications revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured where development arrangements include substantive atrisk milestones revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractuallydefined milestones amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

costs of development services are expensed as incurred costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses once an agreement is finalized these costs are recorded in cost of development services 

inventory valuation 

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand selling prices and production costs should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required further a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we accrue warranty reserves at the time revenue is recognized for the sale of a vehicle or powertrain component warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace 

  

any items under warranty based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly the adjustments that we record may be material 

it is likely that as we sell additional vehicles and powertrain components and as we repair or replace items under warranty we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to service work under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments further a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

valuation of stockbased awards and warrants 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan espp which require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the blackscholes optionpricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and rsus and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures 

the fair value of stock options and the espp were estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the following assumptions 

 

 if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stockbased awards is more reasonable or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for our stockbased awards could change significantly 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

  

the riskfree interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life given our limited history with employee grants we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants the “simplified” method as permitted by the sec is calculated as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options 

our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility and the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries because we have limited trading history on our common stock when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered the stage of development size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies our historical volatility and implied volatility are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

in august 2012 our board of directors granted 5274901 stock options to our ceo 2012 ceo grant the 2012 ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date 

each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten predetermined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 40 billion as compared to the initial market capitalization of 32 billion measured at the time of the 2012 ceo grant 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the term of the 2012 ceo grant is ten years so any tranches that remain unvested at the expiration of the 2012 ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested options will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise based on our current market valuation and operating plans we believe that up to the first three tranches of the 2012 ceo grant all relating to model x will vest during 2014 

we measured the fair value of the 2012 ceo grant using a monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions riskfree interest rate of 165 expected term of ten years expected volatility of 55 and dividend yield of 0 

stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2012 ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met 

as of december 31 2013 the market conditions for three vesting tranches were achieved and the following three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement 

 

  

  

 none of the stock options granted under the 2012 ceo grant has vested as the performance milestones have not yet been achieved as of december 31 2013  however as the above three performance milestones were considered probable of achievement we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 145 million and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

additionally no cash compensation has been received by our ceo for his services to the company 

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2013 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 

  

which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods presented in thousands except per share data 

 

 revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales which include vehicle options and related sales and powertrain component and related sales consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

 

   

automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2013 were 20 billion an increase from 3857 million for the year ended december 31 2012 vehicle options and related sales primarily represent revenues related to deliveries of model s including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems such as battery packs and drive units to other manufacturers 

vehicle options and related sales during the year ended december 31 2013 were 195 billion an increase from 3543 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the significant increase in vehicle options and related sales was primarily driven by the delivery of 22477 model s vehicles for the year including the commencement of european deliveries in august 2013 for the year ended december 31 2012 we had delivered about 2650 model s vehicles following the commencement of our model s deliveries in june 2012 the increase also resulted from higher sales of regulatory credits including 1298 million in zev credit sales for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 324 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program model s customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months for a predetermined resale value we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases and accordingly we defer and amortize to revenues the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee program if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the amount of the resale value guarantee is then recognized in automotive sales through december 31 2013 we delivered approximately 5200 model s vehicles under the resale value guarantee program as of december 31 2013 we recorded 2309 million in deferred revenues and 2363 million in resale value guarantee related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized revenue of 291 million in automotive sales related to this program 

powertrain component and related sales for the periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to toyota under the rav4 ev supply and services agreement which commenced in march 2012 powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2013 were 451 million an increase from 341 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 3857 million an increase from 1486 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 3543 million an increase from 1017 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in vehicle options and related sales was primarily attributable to the commencement of model s customer deliveries in june 2012 and subsequent ramp as well as sales of regulatory credits partially offset by a decrease in the number of tesla roadsters sold as we completed production of the tesla roadster in january 2012 and were selling our remaining inventory primarily in europe and asia 

vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2012 included regulatory credit sales of 405 million compared to regulatory credit sales of 27 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the significant increase in production and delivery of vehicles in the united states allowed us to sell more regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers 

powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 314 million a decrease from 469 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in powertrain component and related sales was primarily due to fewer shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler production for both 

  

the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev programs was substantially completed as of december 31 2011 during the three months ended march 31 2012 we began supplying powertrain systems to toyota under the rav4 ev supply and services agreement and recognized 291 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

development services 

development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automotive manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs drive units and chargers to meet customers’ specifications 

development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was 157 million a decrease from 276 million for the year ended december 31 2012 development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was 276 million a decrease from 557 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 daimler engaged us to assist with the development of a full electric powertrain for a daimler mercedesbenz bclass ev vehicle in 2012 we received two purchase orders from daimler to begin development work and also entered into a separate development agreement under which we would complete various milestones and deliver prototype samples during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we recognized a total 157 million and 159 million in development services revenue respectively related to this program 

in july 2010 we entered into an agreement with toyota to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 under this phase 0 development agreement prototypes were made by us by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery pack power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which would be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 during the year ended december 31 2011 we completed various milestones and delivered several samples under the phase 1 agreement and delivered all development services under the phase 0 agreement during the three months ended march 31 2012 we completed our remaining milestones and delivered samples under the phase 1 agreement development services revenue under these arrangements with toyota for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 107 million and 550 million respectively 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services 

cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2013 was 154 billion an increase from 3717 million for the year ended december 31 2012 cost of automotive sales includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs royalty fees shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand the increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by model s deliveries including the commencement of european deliveries in august 2013 as well as deliveries of electric powertrain component and systems to toyota under the toyota rav4 ev supply and services agreement 

in april 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a model s in the united states and financed their vehicle and vehicle options through one of our specified commercial banking partners and in october 2013 we introduced this program in canada under the program we capitalize the cost of model s into operating lease vehicles and depreciate the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to cost of automotive sales on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the guarantee 

  

program if a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term the remaining operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales as of december 31 2013 we recorded 3770 million in operating lease vehicles net related to model s deliveries with the resale value guarantee for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 194 million in cost of automotive sales related to vehicle depreciation under this program our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred for the year ended december 31 2013 warranty costs incurred for our resale value guarantee vehicles were 16 million 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2013 was 4563 million an increase from 301 million for the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was driven primarily by model s deliveries which began in june 2012 in north america and in august 2013 in europe and the sales of regulatory credits which carry no associated cost of revenues the increase was also attributable to our continuing cost reduction efforts including process efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain design improvements as well as reduction of waste in the supply chain 

cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2012 was 3717 million an increase from 1155 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by the commencement of model s deliveries in june 2012 as well as electric powertrain component and systems sales to toyota as we began to deliver under the toyota rav4 ev supply and services agreement partially offset by a decrease in the number of tesla roadster deliveries and battery packs and chargers delivered to daimler 

cost of development services for the year ended december 31 2012 was 115 million a decrease from 272 million for the year ended december 31 2011 cost of development services includes engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements the decrease in cost of development services was driven primarily by our activities for the toyota rav4 ev program which we substantially completed during the three months ended march 31 2012 partially offset by costs associated with development activities related to the mercedesbenz bclass ev program which we commenced in 2012 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2012 was 301 million a decrease from 616 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was driven primarily by the commencement of model s deliveries and the associated early stage cost inefficiencies including lower fixed cost absorption manufacturing inefficiencies related to production ramp higher initial parts costs and higher logistics costs as our supply chain took time to mature as well as lower sales of the tesla roadster partially offset by the sales of regulatory credits which carry no associated cost of revenues 

we expect our development services gross profit and gross margin may fluctuate in future periods as the timing of revenue recognition may not coincide with the period in which the corresponding cost of revenues is recognized 

research and development expenses 

research and development rd expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in rd expenses also included in rd expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is 

  

not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

rd expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2320 million a decrease from 2740 million for the year ended december 31 2012 rd expenses decreased due to significant development prototyping and testing expenses related to the model s launch in 2012 partially offset by an increase in similar costs in 2013 for model x and righthand drive model s and other programs the 420 million decrease in rd expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 consisted primarily of an 182 million decrease in expensed materials an 85 million decrease in employee compensation expenses a 78 million decrease in costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities a 66 million decrease in shipping charges for model s prototype materials and a 49 million decrease in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs the decrease was partially offset by a 50 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 were 2740 million an increase from 2090 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 650 million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2012 consisted primarily of a 543 million increase in employee compensation expenses from higher headcount a 231 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business a 151 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 33 million increase in shipping charges for prototype materials incurred in the first half of 2012 the increase was partially offset by a 309 million decrease in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s beta and release candidate builds as well as powertrain development activities 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 were 2856 million an increase from 1504 million for the year ended december 31 2012 sga expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and costs to support an expanded retail service and supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business the 1352 million increase in our sga expenses during the year ended december 31 2013 consisted primarily of a 628 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 368 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence a 178 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 172 million increase in professional and outside services costs 

sga expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 were 1504 million an increase from 1041 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 463 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2012 consisted primarily of a 243 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 94 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support an expanded store and service network and the growth of our business in general a 60 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to additional headcount and 

  

generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 60 million increase in professional and outside services costs 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was 364 million an increase from 79 million for the year ended december 31 2012 historically we incurred interest expense primarily from our loans under the doe loan facility and capitalized interest to assets under construction related to significant asset construction for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we capitalized 35 million and 76 million of interest expense to construction in progress respectively 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of notes the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million we incurred 120 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes which we have recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the notes under the terms of the notes 150 coupon interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 12 million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and 59 million of coupon interest expense 

in accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of 828 million in equity the resulting debt discount on the notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 429 over the contractual term of the notes for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized 91 million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount 

in may 2013 we used a portion of the notes offering proceeds to repay our outstanding department of energy doe loan principal of 4396 million a 108 million early repayment fee and accrued interest of 14 million as a result of the extinguishment of our loans unamortized loan origination costs associated with the doe loan facility of 56 million were charged to interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded total interest expense of 178 million related to the early repayment fee accrued interest and the amortization of the remaining loan origination costs on the doe loan facility 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was 79 million and 51 million respectively incurred primarily from our loans under the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities and as of august 2012 we had fully drawn down on the doe loan facility during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we capitalized 76 million and 51 million of interest expense to construction in progress respectively 

other income expense net 

other income expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates prior to the expiration of the doe warrant in may 2013 the doe warrant had been carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income expense net 

other income net for the year ended december 31 2013 was 226 million an increase in income compared to other expense net of 18 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in other income net was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our doe common stock warrant liability of 107 million for the year ended december 31 2013 in march 2013 we entered into a fourth amendment to the doe loan facility which among other things accelerated the maturity date of our doe loans to december 15 2017 

  

therefore the doe warrant was no longer expected to vest the increase in other income net was also attributable to the favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 especially related to the japanese yen 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2012 was 18 million a decrease in expense compared to other expense net of 26 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily due to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact from our foreign currencydenominated liabilities partially offset by the fair value change in our common stock warrant liability during the year ended december 31 2012 resulting from a higher stock price 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013 was 26 million compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase for the year ended december 31 2013 was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we commenced european deliveries of model s in august 2013 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 was 01 million a decrease from 05 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in taxable income in our international jurisdictions as we concluded sales of the tesla roadster 

liquidity and capital resources 

since inception and through the year ended december 31 2013 we had accumulated net operating losses of 114 billion and have used 4667 million of cash in operations as of december 31 2013 we had 8459 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including 4603 million of money market funds 

other sources of cash include cash from our deliveries of model s customer deposits for model s and model x sales of regulatory credits cash from the provision of development services and sales of powertrain components and systems in the short term we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans these capital sources will enable us to fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects including those for our planned model x crossover and certain future products establish and expand our stores service centers and supercharger network and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model x and to continue to ramp up production of model s we may seek additional capital sources to partially fund certain longterm growth initiatives such as to build the tesla gigafactory and for future products such as our third generation vehicle 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we increased the number of superchargers to nearly 90 locations in north america and in europe we expect to continue making investments in the supercharger network in 2014 including in china 

if market conditions are favorable we will continually evaluate alternatives to opportunistically pursue liquidity options also should prevailing economic conditions andor financial business or other factors adversely affect the estimates of our future cash requirements we could be required to fund our cash requirements through additional or alternative sources of financing we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between 650 million and 850 million during the year ending december 31 2014 

  

150 convertible senior notes and bond hedge and warrant transactions 

in may 2013 we issued 6600 million aggregate principal amount of 150 convertible senior notes due 2018 the notes in a public offering the net proceeds from the offering after deducting transaction costs were approximately 6480 million we incurred 120 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes which we have recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the notes the interest under the notes is fixed at 150 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing on december 1 2013 

each 1000 of principal of the notes will initially be convertible into 80306 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 12452 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option on or after march 1 2018 further holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option prior to march 1 2018 only under the following circumstances 1 during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ending september 30 2013 if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes is less than 98 of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period or 3 if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur upon conversion we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount of the note and if applicable shares of our common stock subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock based on a calculated daily conversion value if a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest in addition if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances 

in connection with the offering of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately 12452 per share the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was 1775 million in addition we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase up to approximately 53 million shares of our common stock at a price of 18448 per share we received 1203 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 12452 to 18448 per share 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130 of the applicable conversion price of our notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter furthermore no other conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert have been met as of december 31 2013 therefore the notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2014 and are classified as longterm debt should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2014 or a future quarter the notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter 

for more information on the notes see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

common stock offering and concurrent private placement 

concurrent with the execution of the notes and related transactions in may 2013 we also completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3902862 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately 3551 million which includes 487857 shares or 450 million sold to our chief 

  

executive officer ceo net of underwriting discounts and offering costs we also sold 596272 shares of our common stock to our ceo and received total cash proceeds of 550 million in a private placement at the public offering price 

customer deposits 

customer deposits consist of payments that allow potential customers to place an order for the future purchase of a model s or model x these amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle is delivered we require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer amounts received by us as customer deposits are generally not restricted as to their use by us upon delivery of the vehicle the related customer deposits are applied against the customer’s total purchase price for the vehicle and recognized in automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle sale 

historically we have referred to such customer deposits as reservation payments and these initial reservation payments have been fully refundable until such time that the customer selected the vehicle specifications and entered into a purchase agreement we have eliminated the reservation process for model s in north america and in most of our markets in europe as vehicle production became more reliable and customer wait times decreased customers now initiate their purchase by ordering their customized model s rather than placing a generic reservation in queue as a result of this transition away from reservations we have renamed the “reservation payments” caption on our consolidated financial statements to “customer deposits” customer deposits related to model x still represent fully refundable reservations as of december 31 2013 we held customer deposits of 1632 million

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2013 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 

   

in october 2010 we completed the purchase of our tesla factory located in fremont california from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which could affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any preexisting contamination based on management’s best estimate we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be 53 million as nummi continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our construction and operating activities it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially 

we reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing through december 31 2013 remediation costs of 21 million had been incurred by nummi therefore we classified 21 million of 55 million environmental liabilities to accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we accrued a total of 55 million and 53 million related to these environmental liabilities respectively 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we own our sales and service network and market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet inperson at our corporate events and through our network of tesla stores we were incorporated in delaware in july 2003 opened our first store in los angeles california in may 2008 and introduced our first vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 we are targeting our second vehicle the model s sedan for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster and plan to manufacture model s in higher volumes than those for the tesla roadster first customer deliveries of model s are planned by july 2012 we have also recently revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover a vehicle based on the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized total revenues of 2042 million an increase of 75 over total revenues of 1167 million for the year ended december 31 2010 automotive sales revenue of 1486 million increased 53 from the year ended december 31 2010 driven by strong customer demand for the tesla roadster globally and significantly higher powertrain component sales we completed 2011 with cumulative deliveries worldwide from inception of approximately 2150 roadsters and concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january 2012 we expect to sell our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted 

development services revenue increased to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 197 million for the year ended december 31 2010 due primarily to our development activities for the toyota motor corporation toyota rav4 ev program for a full electric powertrain system we completed planned milestones and deliveries of samples to toyota during the year and we currently expect to complete our remaining development services milestones and sample deliveries during the first quarter of 2012 

we made significant progress on the model s program this year and we remain on schedule to commence customer deliveries by july 2012 during the year we moved from building alpha to beta prototypes and performed detailed testing of systems integration performance and safety our significant efforts in development and testing both of which are ongoing has allowed us to further refine the overall design of model s and its constituent parts as well as the production and assembly processes to manufacture the vehicle in october 2011 

  

we finalized a long term supply contract with panasonic corporation for battery cells to be used in our products which gives us increased visibility into our variable costs 

research and development expenses included expenses related to model s alpha and beta prototype build development of the tesla factory significant engineering design and testing work being undertaken to support model s development design and engineering activities related to model x and other research and development activities research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 2090 million compared to 930 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

in addition to model s engineering we also experienced significant activity at the tesla factory where we intend to produce our model s model x and future vehicles significant construction has taken place and detailed manufacturing readiness plans are being executed almost all of our model s vehicle manufacturing equipment has been installed at the tesla factory as part of our testing and qualifying activities of our manufacturing equipment we are now assembling beta prototype vehicles at the tesla factory and expect to start building release candidate vehicles in the first quarter of 2012 during this process we are continuing to finetune our production processes and incorporate a higher percentage of productionintent components into the cars once we complete these activities the tesla factory will be fully commissioned for production and ready for its intended use as a result of investments being made in the tesla factory and related supplier tooling for model s capital expenditures increased to 1979 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 1054 million for the year ended december 31 2010 our capital expenditures in 2010 were comprised primarily of payments we had made towards the purchase of the tesla factory from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi 

with the opening of our santana row store in 2011 we launched what we believe to be a new and unique retail experience designed to engage and inform potential customers about electric vehicles in general learn about tesla’s innovations and configure their cars through handson interactive screens during the year we further expanded our companyowned retail network with the opening of several more stores in the united states utilizing the new store concept embodied by our santana row tesla store some of these new stores will replace existing stores which we plan to continue using as service locations as a result of our activities to support the sales of the tesla roadster the opening and operation of new stores higher storerelated and marketing activities as well as the growth of our business in general we incurred higher selling general and administrative expenses of 1041 million for the year ended december 31 2011 when compared to expenses of 846 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

in june 2011 we completed a followon offering of common stock in which a total of 6095000 shares of our common stock were sold and received cash proceeds of 1727 million net of underwriting discounts concurrent with this offering we also sold 1416000 shares of common stock to elon musk our chief executive officer and 637475 shares of common stock to blackstar investco llc an affiliate of daimler and received total cash proceeds of 591 million in these private placements no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in connection with these private placements 

along with the proceeds from our public offerings and private placements our continued drawdowns under the department of energy loan facility doe loan facility and other sources of cash including cash from the sales of the tesla roadster development services to toyota sales of powertrain components to daimler and cash received from refundable reservation payments for our model s provided the liquidity to fund our model s model x and powertrain development activities as well as our capital investments in manufacturing infrastructure during the year ended december 31 2011 we received 2044 million in drawdowns under the doe loan facility bringing our total longterm debt under the facility to 2763 million as we continue to progress on our model s and powertrain activities we expect to continue making drawdowns under the doe loan facility 

as of december 31 2011 we had 4927 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the 

  

amount of 2553 million which includes investments in money market funds shortterm marketable securities of 251 million cash of 235 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and 1888 million available under the doe loan facility we expect that these principal sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in 2013 

management opportunities challenges and risks 

our principal focus has continued to be on the disciplined development of model s so that we can commence deliveries by july 2012 we have also been focused on the continued sales of the tesla roadster and powertrain components development services activities with our strategic partners advanced engineering work on the planned model x and pursuing new electric powertrain opportunities with automobile manufacturers 

in january 2012 we concluded the production run of our current generation tesla roadster through december 31 2011 we had delivered approximately 2150 roadsters to customers we plan to sell our remaining tesla roadsters during 2012 primarily in europe and asia until our inventory is depleted 

powertrain component sales in 2011 were driven primarily by our deliveries to supply daimler ag daimler with battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev programs we completed both of these production programs as of december 31 2011 in july 2011 we entered into a supply and services agreement with toyota for the production of an electric powertrain system including a battery pack charging system inverter motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into the toyota rav4 ev additionally we will provide toyota with certain services related to the supply of these components pursuant to the agreement toyota will pay us approximately 100 million from 2012 through 2014 based on our delivery of these components for the toyota rav4 ev due to the wind down of the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev production programs at the end of 2011 we expect powertrain component sales to be limited until the planned start of production of the toyota rav4 ev powertrain system in the first half of 2012 

as we have a limited number of the tesla roadsters left for sale and as we expect powertrain component sales to decline until the start of production for the toyota rav4 ev program we anticipate our automotive sales will decline potentially significantly just prior to the planned launch of our model s the launch of our model s could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues from sales of our electric vehicles and electric powertrain systems 

we completed all of our planned milestones and deliveries of samples to toyota during 2011 and we currently expect to complete our remaining development services milestones and sample deliveries during the first quarter of 2012 as such we expect that the remaining development services revenue under the toyota rav4 ev program will also be recognized in the first quarter since the revenue related to development services milestones are recognized when achieved while milestone costs must be expensed as incurred our development services gross margin will reflect this favorability when we recognize our final toyota rav4 ev milestones in 2012 in november 2011 we received a letter of intent from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line and recently we received a purchase order to begin the development work however we have not yet finalized with daimler the terms for this program and may never do so due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of future milestone revenue and the underlying costs of development services the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period as we have seen under our previous development services agreements including that for the toyota rav4 ev program 

the build of model s beta prototypes continues to progress and we will begin building release candidate vehicles in the first quarter of 2012 we continue to work closely with suppliers to design develop and test components that will meet our anticipated production design specifications and schedule ensuring that our design engineering operations and manufacturing engineering teams and our suppliers execute on all 

  

significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of first customer deliveries of our model s by july 2012 our continuing negotiations with suppliers and the adequate maturation of our manufacturing capabilities will influence our ability to achieve the cost per unit that we are currently projecting our plan to commence deliveries of model s by july 2012 is also dependent upon the timely availability of funds from the doe loan facility upon our finalizing the related design engineering component procurement testing build out and manufacturing plans in a timely manner and upon our ability to execute these plans within the current timeline 

in february 2012 we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv while having high performance features such as a dual motor allwheel drive system we currently plan to start production of model x in the fourth quarter of 2013 with significant deliveries in 2014 our ability to develop and introduce the model x in this timeframe is based on our expectations of leveraging the model s platform additionally if there is a lower level of commonality between model s and model x than anticipated our future development and tooling costs may exceed expectations 

our operating expenses in 2011 have been significant as we continued to execute on the model s program and are systematically and strategically expanding our sales and service infrastructure globally to support the launch of model s as we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch model s as well as incur costs for the development of model x we expect to continue generating a net loss until we reach planned volume sales of model s in 2013 as preproduction expenses and development and prototyping costs cannot be capitalized we expect our operating expenses to continue increasing due to our ongoing activities to prepare the tesla factory for production refine model s through our engineering and testing on beta prototype and release candidate vehicles and continue the advanced engineering work on model x once we start recognizing revenue from the sales of model s our model s production costs including direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead and amortized tooling and logistics will begin to be reflected in cost of automotive sales 

capital spending for the model s program will continue into 2012 as we complete our commissioning activities of the tesla factory and as we make final payments for tooling and manufacturing equipment required for production depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the manufacturing of model s will begin with the start of model s production we anticipate that most of the capital expenditures on model s will continue to be funded by the doe loan facility until the launch of model s we also anticipate our aggregate capital expenditures for 2012 to be comparable to that in 2011 primarily focused on vehicle development and manufacturing activities for model s and model x 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the tesla roadster including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle or zev credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components such as battery packs and battery chargers to other manufacturers we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets prior to february 2010 we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the tesla roadster although a thirdparty lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the united states under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase starting in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states 

automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options accessories and destination charges while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a standalone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items further we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items determined by reference to standalone sales of such items 

to date we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicle accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements as each of these items has stand alone value to the customer revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

effective january 1 2011 we adopted amended accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after january 1 2011 the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price for fiscal 2011 and future periods when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available to date we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicles accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements therefore there were no material differences between total revenue reported and pro forma total revenues that would have been reported during the year ended december 31 2011 if the transactions entered into or materially modified after january 1 2011 were subject to previous accounting guidance 

  

development services 

revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs chargers and sample vehicles to meet a customer’s specifications beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2010 we started entering into such contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured where development arrangements include substantive atrisk milestones revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractuallydefined milestones amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

costs of development services are expensed as incurred costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses once an agreement is finalized these costs are recorded in cost of development services 

prior to 2010 compensation from the smart fortwo ev development arrangement with daimler which is discussed below under “development compensation” was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

development compensation 

we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo ev development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december 31 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time upon entering into the final agreement in may 2009 we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straightline basis this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement beginning in may 2009 and continuing through november 2009 payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones all amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations all development activities under this agreement were completed as of december 31 2009 

marketable securities 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we purchased marketable securities including commercial paper and corporate debt all marketable securities are designated as availableforsale and reported at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included within stockholders’ equity realized gains and losses on the sale of availableforsale marketable securities are recorded in other expense net the cost of availableforsale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method interest dividends amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other expense net availableforsale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as shortterm marketable securities where temporary declines in fair value exist we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 

  

we regularly review all of our marketable securities for otherthantemporary declines in fair value the review includes but is not limited to i the consideration of the cause of the impairment ii the creditworthiness of the security issuers iii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position and iv our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 

inventory valuation 

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded writedowns of 18 million 10 million and 14 million in cost of automotive sales respectively 

the inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand selling prices and production costs should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required further a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to a customer warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly the adjustments that we record may be material as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had 63 million and 54 million in warranty reserves respectively adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of automotive sales 

it is likely that as we sell additional tesla roadsters and powertrain components and as we repair or replace items under warranty we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to service work under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments further a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

valuation of stockbased awards common stock and warrants 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees and employee stock purchase plan espp which require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of the awards is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and six months for the espp stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of forfeitures 

  

the fair value of each stockbased award was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 

 if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stockbased awards is more reasonable or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for our stockbased awards could change significantly 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

the riskfree interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life given our limited history with employee grants we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants the “simplified” method as permitted by the sec is calculated as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options 

our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries because we have limited trading history on our common stock when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered the stage of development size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 

we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and 

  

forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

unadjusted error in 2009 

in june 2010 we identified an error related to the understatement in stockbased compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we granted certain stock options for which a portion of the grant was immediately vested we erroneously accounted for the expense on a straightline basis over the term of the award while expense recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period as a result selling general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended december 31 2009 were understated by 27 million the error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock options as stockbased compensation expense is a noncash item there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 

to correct this error we recorded additional stockbased compensation of 24 million during the three months ended june 30 2010 we considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the three months ended june 30 2010 

common stock valuation 

upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price prior to the ipo we historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our board of directors because there was no public market for our common stock our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used the amount of our stockbased compensation expense net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different the following table summarizes by grant date the number of stock options granted since january 1 2008 through the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 and the associated per share exercise price which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants 

 

 included in the december 4 2009 awards were 6711972 stock options granted to our chief executive officer comprised of two grants in recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for future success the board of directors approved an option grant representing 4 of our fullydiluted share base prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 or 3355986 stock options with 14th of the shares vesting immediately and 136th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month over three years assuming continued employment through each vesting date in addition to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of model s—the board of directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4 of our fullydiluted shares prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows assuming mr musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date 

 

  

  

  

 if mr musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant 

included in our june and september 2010 stock option grants were 666300 and 20000 stock options granted respectively to various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for mr musk above 

  

prior to our ipo which was completed on july 2 2010 our board of directors performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid valuation of privatelyheldcompany equity securities issued as compensation  the enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis income and market approaches or based on a recent round of financing option pricing approach the income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value we have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us as a proxy for our cost of capital our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business for example the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the model s business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the us department of energy 

 

 our projected cash flows were primarily derived from our tesla roadster model s and powertrain revenue streams in more recent valuations these cash flow projections took into account the fact that we had been selling the tesla roadster since 2008 that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended december 31 2009 and our anticipation of model s production in mid2012 

under the market approach the total enterprise value of the company was estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets or businesses that are involved in a public or private transaction prior transactions in our stock were also considered as part of the market approach methodology we selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries these valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects 

for those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach the financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations the risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate as discussed below there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates second we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the optionpricing method the aggregate value of the common stock derived from the optionpricing method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per common share value for those reports before our ipo that relied on the recent round of financing we backsolved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model was consistent with the observed transaction price 

  

our board of directors considered the valuations derived from the approaches above the probability and timing of completing an ipo as of those dates as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations including the following 

 

  

  

  

 our common stock valuations have required the significant use of estimates and assumptions if different estimates and assumptions had been used our common stock valuations could have been significantly different and related stockbased compensation expense may be materially impacted 

warrants 

we have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance we have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and therefore may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future the warrants are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

in january 2010 we issued a warrant to the doe in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility to purchase shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of 251 per share this convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share upon the closing of our ipo in july 2010 beginning on december 15 2018 and until december 14 2022 the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the doe loan facility during the prior quarter the warrant may be exercised until december 15 2023 if we prepay the doe loan facility in part or in full the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting our ability to prepay the doe loan facility and consequently the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrant was determined to represent an embedded derivative this embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 

since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates we measured the fair value of the doe warrant using a monte carlo simulation approach the monte carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the doe loan and the cancellation of the doe warrant over the expected term of the doe loan facility of 13 years for the purposes of the simulation the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us the total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date 

the significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the doe warrant include similar assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates for companies comparable to us the estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a blackscholes 

  

optionpricing model which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation discussed above the differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business as the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies the fair value of our doe warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants similarly as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to the average simulated value of our stock warrant the fair value of our doe warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants and therefore we would not prepay our outstanding doe debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest prior to completion of our ipo the fair value of the doe warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability the doe warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense net as the number of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting the relative movements in our stock price as compared to the credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense net in future periods which may be significant 

excluding the warrant issued to the doe in january 2010 we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a blackscholes optionpricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation as discussed above upon the completion of our ipo in july 2010 these convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding as of june 30 2010 were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled 

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2011 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 

  

which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which revises the manner in which companies present comprehensive income in their financial statements the new guidance removes the presentation options and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either 1 a continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2 two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb further amended its guidance to defer changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments indefinitely the guidance other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which as noted above has been deferred indefinitely is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted we anticipate adopting the guidance in fiscal 2012 we do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers in addition in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level iii inputs a reporting entity will be required to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis the updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level ii and level iii fair value measurements the adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods presented in thousands except per share data 

 

 revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales which include vehicle options and related sales and powertrain component and related sales consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

 

 automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 1486 million an increase from 971 million for the year ended december 31 2010 vehicle options and related sales represent sales of the tesla roadster including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle credits powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components such as battery packs and battery chargers to other manufacturers 

vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 1017 million an increase from 755 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in vehicle options and related sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tesla roadsters that we sold particularly in north america 

  

and asia coupled with slightly higher average selling prices under our supply agreement with lotus we have built 2500 roadster gliders we plan to sell our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases lease revenues are recorded in vehicle options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we recognized 30 million and 08 million respectively during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 6 and 14 of the vehicles delivered during those years were under operating leases as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had deferred revenues of 08 million and 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases respectively 

powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 469 million an increase from 216 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in powertrain component and related sales was primarily due to significant shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler we began delivering battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo ev program at the end of 2009 and for the daimler aclass ev program late in the fourth quarter of 2010 production for both the smart fortwo and aclass ev programs was completed as of december 31 2011 

automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 971 million a decrease from 1119 million for the year ended december 31 2009 vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 755 million a decrease from 1115 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

during the first three quarters of 2009 we continued to fulfill reservations for the tesla roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time as a result a significant portion of the revenue recognized during the first three quarters of 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009 sales of the tesla roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the quarter consequently the comparison of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 versus the year ended december 31 2009 may not be meaningful similarly zev credit sales which are included in vehicle options and related sales were higher during the year ended december 31 2009 as the fulfillment of a significant number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of zev credits the year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states 

powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 216 million compared to 04 million for the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2009 we were selected by daimler to supply it with battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo ev program in a least five european cities we began delivering and recognizing revenue for these production battery packs and chargers at the end of 2009 

prior to 2010 most of our revenues had been generated through sales of our vehicles in the united states and we had no revenues from sales outside of the united states prior to the third quarter of 2009 our international sales commenced with the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and since then we have recognized revenue from sales of the tesla roadster in additional countries including canada japan and hong kong for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 49 55 and 19 of our revenue from vehicle options and related sales respectively were derived outside of the united states for the same periods all of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the united states 

  

development services 

development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs and chargers to meet customer’s specifications 

development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was 557 million an increase from 197 million for the year ended december 31 2010 beginning in the first quarter of 2010 we started entering into development services arrangements with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity we began recognizing development services revenue during the first quarter of 2010 with the development and delivery of modular battery packs for freightliner custom chassis corporation freightliner an affiliate of daimler these battery packs were to be used in electric delivery vans in a limited number of freightliner’s customer trials prior to 2010 compensation that we had received from our first development arrangement with daimler for battery packs and chargers for its smart fortwo ev program was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 we began providing development services for this program during the first quarter of 2010 and had received an aggregate of 55 million in payments however as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of march 31 2010 we deferred the 55 million of payments that had been received from daimler to that point in may 2010 we executed a final agreement under which daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples as of december 31 2010 we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 144 million in development services revenue 

in july 2010 we entered into an agreement with toyota to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 ev under this phase 0 development agreement prototypes would be made by us by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain through june 30 2011 we had completed all prototype vehicles under the phase 0 agreement and for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we recognized 76 million and 13 million in development service revenue respectively 

in october 2010 we also entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery pack power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to this agreement toyota would pay us up to 600 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance including a 50 million upfront payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement during the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we completed various milestones and delivered samples under the phase 1 agreement including the amortization of our upfront payment for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we recognized 474 million and 33 million in development services revenue respectively under the phase 1 agreement we expect that the phase 1 agreement and the associated development services revenues will be completed by early 2012 

we intend to grow our development services revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with other automobile manufacturers and by looking for new development opportunities with existing strategic partners 

additionally we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of our delivery of milestones and samples as well as the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria 

  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 was 1426 million an increase from 860 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in cost of automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in the number of vehicles that we sold and the increased shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler we began delivering battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo ev program at the end of 2009 and for the daimler aclass ev program at the end of 2010 cost of development services includes engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements the increase in cost of development services was driven primarily by our activities for the toyota rav4 ev program which began in the second half of 2010 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2011 was 616 million an increase from 307 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was driven primarily by higher sales of the tesla roadster coupled with higher average selling prices and ongoing cost improvement program on the roadster increased shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler as well as gross profit from our development services activities which we expanded in the latter half of 2010 with the toyota rav4 ev program 

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 was 860 million a decrease from 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease in cost of revenues was driven primarily by the significant number of vehicles delivered during the first three quarters of 2009 from fulfilling customer reservations placed prior to 2009 the decrease in cost of revenues from automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 was partially offset by the increase in cost of revenues from our development services activities 

cost of development services includes engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements during the quarter ended march 31 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs related to this program in cost of revenues 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was 307 million an increase from 95 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was driven primarily by the gross profit contributed by our development services revenues which we began to recognize in 2010 an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers the continued launch of the tesla roadster internationally where in certain markets we have experienced higher selling prices and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster 2 during the second half of 2009 gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the aclass development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 did not have any corresponding cost of revenues since these costs were recorded in research and development expenses prior to us finalizing the development agreement in may 2010 

we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria this may cause our gross profit and gross margin to be similarly impacted 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping 

  

expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in research and development expenses also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 2090 million an increase from 930 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 1160 million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 consisted primarily of a 381 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha and beta builds overhead costs related to the tesla factory powertrain development activities a 309 million increase in costs related to model s and model x engineering design and testing activities incurred by our suppliers a 304 million increase in employee compensation expenses from higher headcount a 97 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants and a 70 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 930 million an increase from 193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 included 232 million in daimler smart fortwo ev development compensation which was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses the 737 million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 250 million increase in employee cash and stockbased compensation expenses primarily associated with significantly higher headcount to support our model s and powertrain development activities the 232 million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 a 105 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha build as well as powertrain development activities a 107 million increase in professional and outside services costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities and a 16 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including our transition to our palo alto headquarters 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs associated with this program in cost of revenues 

we have significantly increased our research and development efforts for model s which has resulted in an increase in our research and development expenses we anticipate that our research and development expenses will rise moderately as we incur additional costs to further develop model s to develop model x and to operate our tesla factory in fremont california prior to the start of model s production 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 were 1041 million an increase from 846 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 195 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 consisted primarily of a 

  

123 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 41 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business a 24 million increase in professional and outside services costs and a 17 million increase in costs principally related to our tesla store and gallery openings the increase is also attributable to a 10 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants the increase for the year ended december 31 2011 was partially offset by an additional stockbased compensation charge of 24 million recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 which reflected a correction of stockbased compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 846 million an increase from 422 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 424 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 158 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards expense related to performancebased awards an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants made in 2010 and an additional stockbased compensation charge of 24 million which reflected a correction of stockbased compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 a 134 million increase in employee cash compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support a larger number of stores in the united states and europe and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 71 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including the opening of new stores and service locations and our transition to our palo alto headquarters a 32 million increase in travel and expenses related to our sales and marketing activities and a 10 million increase in professional services costs related to ongoing trademark and patent work recruiting as well as general corporate development activities 

we expect selling general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations increase our sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and prepare for the planned model s commercial launch by july 2012 and as we support the requirements of being a public company we plan to open additional stores and service centers during 2012 mostly in the united states and some of these stores will replace existing stores which we may continue to use as service locations 

interest expense 

our interest expense is primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in 2010 although interest expense will increase as we continue to draw down on the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities we expect to capitalize this interest to construction in progress until the start of model s production during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we capitalized 51 million and 08 million respectively of interest expense to construction in progress 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 10 million a decrease from 25 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily related to our convertible notes which were converted into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may 2009 while interest expense during the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in 2010 

other expense net 

other expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our warrant liabilities and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates income or charges resulting from 

  

the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability excluding the doe warrant liability was eliminated after july 2 2010 as these warrants were net exercised at the completion of our ipo the doe convertible preferred stock warrant which we issued in january 2010 became a common stock warrant on july 2 2010 and is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2011 was 26 million a decrease from other expense net of 66 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease in expense for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to the elimination of warrant liabilities excluding the doe warrant liability upon the completion of our ipo in july 2010 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 was 66 million an increase in expense compared to other expense net of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to the fair value changes in our warrant liabilities as well as the liability related to common stock warrants to certain of our stockholders which we issued in may 2010 both of which increased significantly in conjunction with the increase in our common stock valuation 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2011 was 05 million an increase from 02 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 was 02 million an increase from 26000 for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was due primarily to the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and the ensuing increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

since inception and through the year ended december 31 2011 we had accumulated net operating losses of 6694 million and have used 4450 million of cash in operations as of december 31 2011 we had 4927 million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 2553 million which included investments in money market funds our shortterm marketable securities in the amount of 251 million cash of 235 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and approximately 1888 million available under the doe loan facility which is primarily intended to cover spending related to the development of model s and our powertrain activities other sources of cash also include cash from the sales of the tesla roadster cash from the provision of development services sales of powertrain components and refundable reservation payments for our model s 

we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility together with our anticipated cash from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in 2013 this capital will fund our ongoing operations continue research and development projects establish sales and service centers improve infrastructure such as expanded battery pack assembly facilities and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model s and to continue development of model x the acceleration of the development of future vehicles investments in new technologies increased insourcing of manufacturing capabilities investments to expand our powertrain activities or further expand our sales and service network may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit we may also choose to opportunistically raise additional funds if market conditions are favorable we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

  

doe loan facility 

on january 20 2010 we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb and the doe pursuant to the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing atvm incentive program such loan facility including amendments thereto the doe loan facility under the doe loan facility the ffb has made available to us two multidraw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to 4650 million up to an aggregate principal amount of 1012 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding for the powertrain engineering and the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors and electric components the powertrain facility up to an aggregate principal amount of 3639 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80 of the costs eligible for funding for the development of and to build out the manufacturing facility for our model s sedan the model s facility under the doe loan facility we are responsible for the remaining 20 of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project 

our doe loan facility drawdowns were as follows in thousands 

 

 in february 2012 we received additional loans under the doe loan facility of 144 million at interest rates ranging from 09 to 14 

we have agreed that in connection with the sale of our stock in any followon equity offering at least 50 of the net offering proceeds will be received by us offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers directors employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the doe 

upon completion of our ipo in 2010 we set aside 100 million to fund a separate dedicated account under our doe loan facility this dedicated account is used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and tesla factory projects and is used as a mechanism to defer advances under the doe loan facility this will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the doe loans but will require us to use the dedicated account 

  

to fund certain project costs upfront which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the doe loan facility once the dedicated account is depleted or as part of the final advance for the applicable project we will be then required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30 of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the drawdown of additional loans under the doe loan facility once used in full or as part of the final advance for the applicable project depending on the timing and magnitude of our drawdowns and the funding requirements of the dedicated account the balance of the dedicated account will fluctuate throughout the period in which we plan to make drawdowns under the doe loan facility upon completion of our final advance under the doe loan facility the balance in the dedicated account will be fully transferred out of the dedicated account as of december 31 2011 and 2010 235 million and 736 million were held in the dedicated account respectively 

for more information on the doe loan facility see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

in november 2010 we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation panasonic pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 1418573 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of 300 million 

followon offering and concurrent private placements 

in june 2011 we completed a followon offering of common stock in which we sold a total of 6095000 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of 1727 million from this transaction net of underwriting discounts 

concurrent with our followon offering we also sold 1416000 shares of our common stock to elon musk our chief executive officer and cofounder and 637475 shares of our common stock to blackstar investco llc an affiliate of daimler and received total cash proceeds of 591 million in the private placements no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in connection with these private placements 

leasing activities 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value 

when compared to our sales of vehicles our leasing activities will spread the cash inflows that we would otherwise receive upon the sale of a vehicle over the lease term and final disposition of the leased vehicle as such our cash and working capital requirements will be directly impacted and if leasing volume increases significantly the impact may be material however after taking into consideration our current and planned sources of operating cash our ability to monitor and prospectively adjust our leasing activity as well as our intent to collect nonrefundable deposits for leased vehicles that are manufactured to specification we do not believe that our leasing operations materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments and obligations as they become due as we will also be exposed to credit risk related to the timely collection of lease payments from our customers we intend to utilize our credit approval and ongoing review processes in order to 

  

minimize any credit losses that could occur and which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we require deposits from customers electing a lease option for vehicles built to a customer’s specifications on the same timeframe and under the same circumstances as from customers purchasing our vehicles outright during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 approximately 6 and 14 of the vehicles delivered during these periods were under operating leases as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had deferred revenues of 08 million and 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases through december 31 2011 our leasing activity has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 

reservation payments 

a source of our cash flows from operations has been through our receipt of reservation payments from our customers reservation payments consist of reservation payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a tesla roadster model s or model x for our tesla roadsters manufactured to specification our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the country of purchase for model s and model x we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least 5000 for tesla roadsters purchased directly from our showrooms no deposit is required prior to the second quarter of 2010 our reservation policy was to accept reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a tesla roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications during the second quarter of 2010 we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for tesla roadsters manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement however we also occasionally accept reservation payments for the tesla roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications for customers who have placed a reservation payment with us the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement the full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle is required only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer reservation payments for a vehicle are recorded as a current liability when received no later than upon the delivery of a vehicle the reservation payments collected on a customer’s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle 

summary of cash flows 

 

 cash flows from operating activities 

we continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the united states and internationally our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

net cash used in operating activities was 1144 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of 2544 million which included noncash charges of 294 million related to stockbased compensation expense 169 million related to depreciation and amortization and 28 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liability significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 3131 million of operating expenses 1426 million of cost of revenues and a 136 million increase in inventory and operating lease vehicles partially offset by a 442 million increase in 

  

accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a 26 million increase in other longterm liabilities inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the tesla roadster as we planned for the final production of the tesla roadster and powertrain component sales as well as leasing activities the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business and the timing of vendor payments 

significant operating cash inflows during the year ended december 31 2011 were comprised primarily of automotive sales of 1486 million 557 million of development services revenue and a 610 million net increase in reservation payments partially offset by a 28 million increase in accounts receivable and a 19 million decrease in deferred revenue the increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to receivables from toyota for shipments of powertrain components under the toyota rav4 ev phase 1 contract services agreement and shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler under the daimler smart fortwo and aclass ev programs 

net cash used in operating activities was 1278 million during the year ended december 31 2010 the largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of 1543 million which included noncash charges of 212 million related to stockbased compensation expense 106 million related to depreciation and amortization and 50 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liabilities significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1776 million of operating expenses 860 million of cost of revenues a 285 million increase in inventory and operating lease vehicles and a 50 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 133 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 35 million increase in other longterm liabilities inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the tesla roadster and powertrain component sales while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business as well as our increased manufacturing and model s development activities operating lease vehicles increased with the introduction of our leasing program in 2010 other longterm liabilities increased as a result of higher warranty liability from sales of the tesla roadster 

significant operating cash inflows during the year ended december 31 2010 were derived primarily from automotive sales of 971 million 197 million of development services revenue a 48 million increase in deferred revenues and a 47 million increase in reservation payments partially offset by a 32 million increase in accounts receivable in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery pack power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software to be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 upon execution of the agreement we received a 50 million upfront payment for which revenue is being recognized over the expected term of our performance deferred revenues also increased from our vehicle leasing activities as lease downpayments are recognized over the term of the operating leases the increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to daimler’s smart fortwo ev program as well as 23 million receivable from toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the phase 1 contract services agreement during the year ended december 31 2010 we received 104 million of net new reservation payments for model s while reservation payments for the tesla roadster decreased by 57 million 

net cash used in operating activities was 808 million during the year ended december 31 2009 the largest component of our cash used during this year was the 557 million net loss which included noncash charges of 69 million related to depreciation and amortization 27 million related to interest on convertible notes and 14 million related to inventory writedowns as well as a noncash gain of 15 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1024 million of cost of revenues 614 million of operating expenses a 79 million increase in inventory and a 20 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 34 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 09 million increase in accounts payable inventory increased to meet our production requirements while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflect a higher level of annual operating costs such as insurance licenses and taxes from the growth of the business the increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were also primarily due to the growth in our business 

  

significant operating cash inflows during the year ended december 31 2009 were derived primarily from the sales of the tesla roadster as well as development compensation related to the daimler development agreement cash inflows related to automotive sales activity were 885 million comprised of 1119 million of automotive sales partially offset by a 220 million decrease in refundable reservation payments and a 15 million decrease in deferred revenues the decrease in the refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the tesla roadster during the year ended december 31 2008 as we continued to deliver the tesla roadster to our customers in 2009 we applied the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost cash inflows from the daimler development agreement were 132 million comprised primarily of 232 million of development compensation partially offset by a 100 million decrease in deferred development compensation the decrease in deferred development compensation was the result of the amortization of deferred development compensation that we received during the year ended december 31 2008 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations including investments in model s manufacturing as well as restricted cash that we must maintain in relation to our doe loan facility facility lease agreements equipment financing and certain vendor credit policies 

net cash used in investing activities was 1759 million during the year ended december 31 2011 primarily related to 1979 million in purchases of capital equipment and 650 million in purchases of shortterm marketable securities partially offset by 501 million of net transfers out of our dedicated doe account in accordance with the provisions of the doe loan facility and 400 million from the maturity of shortterm marketable securities the increase in capital purchases was primarily due to significant development and construction activities at the tesla factory as well as purchases of model s related manufacturing equipment and tooling 

net cash used in investing activities was 1803 million during the year ended december 31 2010 primarily related to capital purchases of 1054 million and a net increase in restricted cash of 749 million the increase in capital purchases was driven primarily by 652 million of payments made in relation to our purchase of our tesla factory located in fremont california from nummi and certain manufacturing assets located thereon to be used for our model s manufacturing as well as 402 million primarily related to other model s capital expenditures our transition to and build out of our powertrain manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters in palo alto california and purchases of manufacturing equipment our purchase transactions with nummi were completed in october 2010 the increase in restricted cash was primarily related to 1000 million of net proceeds from our ipo and concurrent toyota private placement that we transferred to a dedicated account as required by our doe loan facility partially offset by 264 million that was transferred out of the dedicated account during the third and fourth quarters of 2010 in accordance with the provisions of the doe loan facility 

net cash used in investing activities was 142 million during the year ended december 31 2009 primarily related to capital purchases of 119 million and an increase in restricted cash of 24 million the increase in restricted cash was primarily related to standard credit policies required by our online payment vendor and security deposits related to lease agreements and equipment financing 

cash flows from financing activities 

we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of 2968 million on a cumulative basis through december 31 2009 from loans under the doe loan facility beginning in 2010 and more recently from the net proceeds from our public offerings and private placements of common stock 

net cash provided by financing activities was 4460 million during the year ended december 31 2011 and was comprised primarily of 2315 million received from our followon public offering and concurrent private

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2011 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 

 in october 2010 we completed the purchase of our tesla factory located in fremont california from nummi nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any preexisting contamination based on management’s best estimate we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be 53 million which is not reflected in the table above as the timing of any potential payments cannot be reasonably determined at this time as nummi continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our construction and operating activities it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially 

we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over a ten year period we will pay the first 150 million of any costs of any governmentallyrequired remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions and nummi has agreed to pay the next 150 million for such remediation activities our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first 150 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing 

on the tenyear anniversary of the closing or whenever 300 million has been spent on the remediation activities whichever comes first nummi’s liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claims except for nummi’s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement 

  

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we held reservation payments of 918 million and 308 million from potential customers respectively which are not reflected in the table above as of december 31 2011 we held reservation payments for undelivered model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 900 million and payments for tesla roadsters in an aggregate amount of 18 million as of december 31 2010 we held reservation payments for undelivered model s sedans in an aggregate amount of 283 million and payments for tesla roadsters in an aggregate amount of 25 million in order to convert the reservation payments into revenue we will need to sell vehicles to these customers all reservation payments for model s are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

overview and 2010 highlights 

we design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components we own our sales and service network and market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet inperson at our corporate events and through our network of tesla stores we were incorporated in delaware in 2003 opened our first store in los angeles california in may 2008 and introduced our first vehicle the tesla roadster in early 2008 in july 2009 we introduced a new roadster model the tesla roadster 2 and its higher performance option package roadster sport as well as launched the tesla roadster in europe on july 1 2010 we introduced the roadster 25 with new styling and an upgraded interior 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we experienced solid performance from sales of the tesla roadster especially considering that the automotive sales recognized in 2009 were driven primarily from the fulfillment of a significant reservations list that had accumulated prior to and through 2009 our automotive sales revenues in 2010 were primarily driven by retail store expansion globally and higher sales and marketing activities higher average selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states during 2010 we continued to expand our presence in europe and introduced the tesla roadster in canada and in asia our network of stores increased to 16 stores by the end of 2010 and as of december 31 2010 we had sold over 1500 tesla roadsters to customers in 31 countries with sales volume being concentrated in the united states and in europe 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster and during the latter half of 2010 we began offering a leasing alternative in canada under our program we permit qualifying customers to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases lease revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were 08 million and are recorded as part of our automotive sales revenue approximately 14 of the tesla roadsters delivered during 2010 were under operating leases 

we continued to expand our electric powertrain component and development activities with other automotive manufacturers by the end of 2009 we had completed the development of a battery pack and charger for daimler ag’s daimler smart fortwo electric drive and were selected by daimler to supply it initially with 

  

up to 1000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities in 2010 we made significant deliveries of the smart fortwo battery packs and chargers to daimler which contributed approximately 21 million to our automotive sales revenue since 2009 daimler has increased its orders under this program with the current total order at 1800 battery packs and chargers production of the battery packs and chargers is expected to continue through mid2011 during the year daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 a formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with daimler in may 2010 and upon completion of the aclass battery pack and charger in october we started recognizing revenue from the delivery of production battery packs and chargers for the daimler aclass program which we expect to continue through the balance of 2011 

in may 2010 we and toyota motor corporation toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles and for us to receive toyota’s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the model s in july 2010 we and toyota entered into an early phase 0 agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 with an aim by toyota to market the electric vehicle in the united states in 2012 prototypes would be made by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain we began developing and delivering prototypes to toyota for evaluation during the latter half of the year in connection with this program in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to our agreements toyota will pay us up to 69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance we expect to achieve our deliverables through late 2011 or early 2012 

as a result of solid sales of the tesla roadster as well as increased powertrain component sales and the commencement of development services revenues from both daimler and toyota total revenues for 2010 were 1167 million an increase over total revenues of 1119 million in 2009 

we are designing our second vehicle the planned model s for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster and plan to manufacture the model s in higher volumes than our current volumes for the tesla roadster model s development progressed well during 2010 culminating in the completion of our first drivable alpha prototype in december expenses related to the model s alpha prototype build increased production and engineering headcount and other important engineering design and testing work being undertaken at several of our suppliers to support model s readiness contributed to the 737 million increase in research and development expenses from 2009 to 930 million in 2010 

alongside model s engineering and manufacturing engineering development we also completed the purchase of our fremont manufacturing facility in october which we intend to use for the production of our planned model s and future vehicles in may 2010 we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility in fremont california from new united motor manufacturing inc nummi which is a joint venture between toyota and motors liquidation company the owner of selected assets of general motors in october 2010 we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land the purchase totals 210 acres or approximately 55 of the land at the site and includes all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon in october 2010 we and nummi amended the facility purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits for additional consideration the aggregate purchase price that we paid to nummi was 485 million including the operating permits 

in august 2010 we entered into an additional purchase agreement with nummi for the purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts located at the fremont facility this purchase agreement was subsequently amended to include additional manufacturing equipment and spare parts and in october 2010 we completed this purchase concurrent with the completion of the facility purchase the aggregate purchase price that we paid for these assets was 167 million the purchase of the fremont manufacturing facility and assets 

  

along with other model s related investments and investments that we made at our palo alto california corporate headquarters and powertrain facility brought our capital expenditures up to 1054 million in 2010 from 119 million for 2009 

we completed several significant financing transactions in 2010 to help progress our model s and powertrain development activities as well as support our capital investments in manufacturing infrastructure 

 

  

  

 management opportunities challenges and risks—2011 outlook 

our focus for 2011 continues to be on the disciplined development and preparation for the launch of the planned model s in mid2012 as well as the continued growth of revenues through sales of the tesla roadster and our powertrain sales and development activities with our strategic partners 

we expect sales of the tesla roadster to grow over 2010 but expect some seasonality during the winter months we have a supply agreement with lotus to purchase a minimum of 2400 tesla roadster vehicles or gliders through december 31 2010 we have delivered over 1500 vehicles we currently intend to manufacture the majority of our gliders with lotus for our current generation tesla roadster until january 2012 and we intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the tesla roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted accordingly we intend to offer a limited number of tesla roadsters for sale in 2012 to the extent we wish to sell additional tesla roadsters with the lotus gliders beyond the number of vehicles we have contracted for we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with lotus but may be unable to do so on terms and conditions favorable to us if at all we do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation tesla roadster until at least one year after the launch of the model s and we intend to perform such manufacturing entirely in our own facilities continued difficult economic conditions competition from third parties and the planned availability of the model s in 2012 could result in depressed sales of the tesla roadster in 2011 we expect to continue to experience seasonality for sales of the tesla roadster we also anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of model s reservations during the second half of 2011 as we work towards the launch of our planned model s in mid2012 

as a result of our expanded electric powertrain supply and development services activities with our strategic partners in 2010 we will have significant deliveries and milestones to achieve in 2011 along with the supply of battery packs and chargers for daimler’s smart fortwo ev and aclass programs we will also have important development milestones and prototypes to deliver to toyota as part of our toyota rav4 agreements although our current agreements with daimler and toyota provide us with increased revenue potential in 2011 from powertrainrelated activities we do not yet have finalized any agreements with daimler or toyota for significant sales or services beyond 2011 

  

model s development will continue to be a primary focus for 2011 ensuring that our engineering operations and manufacturing engineering teams execute on all significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of our model s in mid2012 our progress towards our beta prototype activities as well as readiness of our manufacturing capabilities will influence our ability to achieve the manufacturing cost per unit that we are currently projecting 

in 2011 we publicly announced the tesla model x as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform we are designing the model x as a crossover vehicle we intend to develop a prototype of the model x by the end of 2011 the acceleration of the development of future vehicles including the tesla model x may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

our operating expenses are expected to increase in 2011 as we continue to execute on the model s program systematically and strategically expand our sales and marketing activities globally to support the launch of the model s as well as to maintain and support the overall activities of a growing public company as we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch the model s we expect to continue generating a net loss despite anticipated growth in revenues and improvements in margin cost control within our operations especially in general and administrative continues to be an important objective 

capital spending for the model s program is anticipated to be at its highest level in 2011 as we plan to purchase much of the tooling and manufacturing equipment required for production inclusive of nonmodel s related investments aggregate capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be in the range of 190 million to 215 million the majority of these capital investments should be reimbursable under the terms of our doe loan facility with this level of capital spending we can execute on our strategic decision to increase insourcing primarily in stampings and plastics we have also elected to invest incrementally in new technologies primarily in our paint and body shops to produce vehicles at a higher quality at an affordable cost 

furthermore we are investing in additional plant automation which provides us with the flexibility to expand capacity to produce up to 20000 units on just one shift this investment would have a relatively short payback in terms of saved labor and overhead costs additionally plant automation will allow us to accommodate either higher model s production or the efficient introduction of future models as significant capital investment is required to bring our fremont facility and model s manufacturing assets to a state of production readiness all depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the fremont facility will begin with the start of model s production 

unadjusted error in 2009 

in june 2010 we identified an error related to the understatement in stockbased compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we granted certain stock options for which a portion of the grant was immediately vested we erroneously accounted for the expense on a straightline basis over the term of the award while expense recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period as a result selling general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended december 31 2009 were understated by 27 million the error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock options as stockbased compensation expense is a noncash item there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 

to correct this error we recorded additional stockbased compensation of 24 million during the three months ended june 30 2010 we considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in 

  

operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the three months ended june 30 2010 we also evaluated this control deficiency in the context of our internal control over financial reporting and based on the magnitude nature and extent of the error determined that such deficiency would be considered a significant deficiency a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the company’s financial reporting 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

automotive sales 

we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the tesla roadster including vehicle options accessories and destination charges vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle or zev credits we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components such as battery packs and battery chargers to other manufacturers we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 

automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets prior to february 2010 we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the tesla roadster although a thirdparty lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the united states under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase starting in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states 

automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options accessories and destination charges while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements when to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized we are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a standalone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items further we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items determined by reference to standalone sales of such items 

  

to date we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles vehicle accessories and options separately outside of any multiple element arrangements as each of these items has stand alone value to the customer revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods

revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers including the design and development of battery packs and chargers to meet a customer’s specifications beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2010 we started entering into such contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured where development arrangements include substantive atrisk milestones revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractuallydefined milestones amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 we had deferred 40 million in revenue related to development services being performed for toyota increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

costs of development services are expensed as incurred costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses once an agreement is finalized these costs are recorded in cost of development services 

prior to 2010 compensation from the smart fortwo development arrangement with daimler which is discussed below under “development compensation” was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

development compensation 

we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december 31 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time upon entering into the final agreement in may 2009 we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straightline basis this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement beginning in may 2009 and continuing through november 2009 payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones all amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations all development activities under this agreement were completed as of december 31 2009 

inventory valuation 

we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis we record inventory writedowns for estimated 

  

obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are written off 

we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 

once inventory is writtendown a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we recorded writedowns of 10 million and 14 million in cost of automotive sales respectively during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded writedowns of 37 million to research and development expenses and 06 million to cost of automotive sales 

the inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand selling prices and production costs should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change material changes to these reserves may be required further a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

warranties 

we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to a customer warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations and we will adjust our estimates as needed initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly the adjustments that we record may be material as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had 54 million and 38 million in warranty reserves respectively adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of automotive sales 

it is likely that as we sell additional tesla roadsters and powertrain components we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments further a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 

valuation of stockbased awards common stock and warrants 

stockbased compensation 

we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award the fair value of the awards is estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four years stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of forfeitures 

the fair value of each new employee option awarded was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 

   

if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly 

the blackscholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 

the riskfree interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life given our limited history with employee grants we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants the “simplified” method as permitted by the sec is calculated as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options 

our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries because we have no trading history on our common stock when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered the stage of development size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

as we accumulate additional employee option data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities expected lives and forfeiture rates which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded in our cost of sales research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

we account for stock options issued to nonemployees also based on their estimated fair value determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model however the fair value of the equity awards granted to nonemployees is remeasured as the awards vest and the resulting increase in value if any is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 

common stock valuation 

upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price prior to the ipo we historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our board of directors because there has been no public market for our common stock our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used the amount of our stockbased compensation expense net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different the following table summarizes by grant date the number of stock options granted since january 1 2008 through the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 and the associated per share exercise price which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants 

 

 included in the december 4 2009 awards were 6711972 stock options granted to our chief executive officer comprised of two grants in recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for future success the board of directors approved an option grant representing 4 of our fullydiluted share base prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 or 3355986 stock options with 14th of the shares vesting immediately and 136th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month over three years assuming continued employment through each vesting date in addition to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of the model s—the board of directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4 of our fullydiluted shares prior to such grant as of december 4 2009 with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows assuming mr musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date 

 

  

  

  

   

if mr musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant 

included in our june and september 2010 stock option grants were 666300 and 20000 stock options granted respectively to various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for mr musk above 

prior to our ipo which was completed on july 2 2010 our board of directors performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid valuation of privatelyheldcompany equity securities issued as compensation  the enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis income and market approaches or based on a recent round of financing option pricing approach the income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value we have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us as a proxy for our cost of capital our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business for example the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the model s business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the us department of energy 

 

 our projected cash flows have been primarily derived from our tesla roadster model s and powertrain revenue streams in more recent valuations these cash flow projections take into account the fact that we have been selling the tesla roadster since 2008 that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended december 31 2009 and our anticipation of model s production in mid2012 

under the market approach the total enterprise value of the company is estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets or businesses that are involved in a public or private transaction prior transactions in our stock are also considered as part of the market approach methodology we have selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive oem automotive retail automotive parts and battery technology industries these valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects 

for those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach the financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations the risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate as discussed below there is inherent 

  

uncertainty in these estimates second we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the optionpricing method the aggregate value of the common stock derived from the optionpricing method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per common share value for those reports before our ipo that relied on the recent round of financing we backsolved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model was consistent with the observed transaction price 

our board of directors considered the valuations derived from the approaches above the probability and timing of completing an ipo as of those dates as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations including the following 

 

  

  

  

 valuations that we have performed require significant use of estimates and assumptions if different estimates and assumptions had been used our common stock valuations could be significantly different and related stockbased compensation expense may be materially impacted 

warrants 

we have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance we have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and therefore may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future the warrants are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

in january 2010 we issued a warrant to the doe in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility to purchase shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of 251 per share this convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 754 per share upon the closing of our ipo in july 2010 beginning on december 15 2018 and until december 14 2022 the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the doe loan facility during the prior quarter the warrant may be exercised until december 15 2023 if we prepay the doe loan facility in part or in full the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting our ability to prepay the doe loan facility and consequently the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrant was determined to represent an embedded derivative this embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 

since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates we measured the fair value of the doe warrant using a monte carlo simulation approach the monte carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the doe loan and the cancellation of the doe warrant over the expected term of the doe loan facility of 13 years for the purposes of the simulation the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us the total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date 

  

the significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the doe warrant include similar assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates for companies comparable to us the estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a blackscholes optionpricing model which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation discussed above the differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business as the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies the fair value of our doe warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants similarly as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to the average simulated value of our stock warrant the fair value of our doe warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants and therefore we would not prepay our outstanding doe debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest prior to completion of our ipo the fair value of the doe warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet upon the completion of our ipo on july 2 2010 this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability the doe warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense net as the number of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting as of december 31 2010 the fair value of the doe warrant was 61 million the relative movements in our stock price as compared to the credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense net in future periods which may be significant 

excluding the warrant issued to the doe in january 2010 we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a blackscholes optionpricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stockbased compensation as discussed above upon the completion of our ipo in july 2010 these convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding as of june 30 2010 were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled 

income taxes 

we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans as of december 31 2010 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 

  

furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain as a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes such as net operating losses based on our estimates of the eventual outcome these effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires companies to allocate revenue in multipleelement arrangements based on an element’s estimated selling price if vendorspecific or other thirdparty evidence of value is not available the guidance is effective beginning january 1 2011 with early application permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers in addition in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level iii inputs a reporting entity will be required to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis the updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level ii and level iii fair value measurements the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the disclosures regarding the reconciliation of level iii fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update which provides guidance on the criteria to be followed in recognizing revenue under the milestone method the milestone method of recognition allows a vendor who is involved with the provision of deliverables to recognize the full amount of a milestone payment upon achievement if at the inception of the revenue arrangement the milestone is determined to be substantive as defined in the standard the guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 

 

 revenues 

automotive sales 

automotive sales consisted of the following for the periods presented 

 

 automotive sales during the year ended december 31 2010 were 971 million a decrease from 1119 million during the year ended december 31 2009 automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 consisted of 755 million of vehicle options and related sales and 216 million of powertrain component and related sales compared to 1116 million of vehicle options and related sales and 04 million of powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december 31 2009 automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2008 were 147 million comprised primarily of sales of the tesla roadster which we began to deliver in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as related zero emission vehicle or zev credits almost all of the revenue recognized during the year ended december 31 2008 came from fulfilling reservations placed in prior periods 

  

during the first three quarters of 2009 we continued to fulfill reservations for the tesla roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time as a result a significant portion of the revenue recognized during the first three quarters of 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009 sales of the tesla roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the quarter consequently the comparison of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 versus the year ended december 31 2009 may not be meaningful as such vehicle options and related sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were more reflective of current demand as compared to the prior year similarly zev credit sales which are included in vehicle options and related sales were higher during the year ended december 31 2009 as the fulfillment of a significant number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of zev credits the year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases lease revenues are recorded in vehicle options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 08 million during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 14 of the vehicles delivered during the year were under operating leases as of december 31 2010 we had deferred revenues of 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases 

powertrain component and related sales were comprised primarily of battery packs and chargers that we delivered to supply daimler’s smart fortwo program we have been selected by daimler to supply it with up to 1800 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo electric drive in at least five european cities we began delivering and recognizing revenue for these production battery packs and chargers at the end of 2009 

prior to 2010 most of our revenues had been generated through sales of our vehicles in the united states and we had no revenues from sales outside of the united states prior to the third quarter of 2009 our international sales commenced with the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and since then we have recognized revenue from sales of the tesla roadster in additional countries including canada japan and hong kong for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 55 and 19 of our revenue from vehicle options and related sales respectively were derived outside of the united states all of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the united states as we continue to expand into additional new markets we expect our international automotive sales to increase in aggregate dollar amounts but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues 

while revenue related to servicing vehicles has been insignificant to date we expect such revenues to increase in future periods as we sell more vehicles and as vehicle warranties begin to expire 

development services 

beginning in the first quarter of 2010 we started entering into development services arrangements with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenuegenerating activity we began recognizing development services revenue during the first quarter of 2010 with the development and delivery of modular battery packs for freightliner custom chassis corporation or freightliner an affiliate of daimler these battery packs were to be used in electric delivery vans in a limited number of freightliner’s customer trials prior to 2010 compensation that we had received from our first development arrangement with daimler 

  

for battery packs and chargers for its smart fortwo program was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 we began providing development services for this program during the first quarter of 2010 and had received an aggregate of 55 million in payments however as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of march 31 2010 we deferred the 55 million of payments that had been received from daimler to that point in may 2010 we executed a final agreement under which daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples as of december 31 2010 we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized 144 million in development services revenue 

in july 2010 we and toyota entered into a phase 0 agreement to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav4 under this early phase development agreement prototypes would be made by us by combining the toyota rav4 model with a tesla electric powertrain during the year ended december 31 2010 we began producing and delivering prototypes to toyota and recognized 10 million in development services revenue 

in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 pursuant to this agreement toyota will pay us up to 600 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance including a 50 million upfront payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement during the year ended december 31 2010 we completed the first milestone and along with the amortization of our upfront payment we recognized 33 million in development services revenue 

we intend to grow our development services revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with daimler toyota and other automobile manufacturers additionally we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 was 860 million a decrease from 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease in cost of revenues was driven primarily by the significant number of vehicles delivered during the first three quarters of 2009 from fulfilling customer reservations placed prior to 2009 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly we record cost of automotive sales equal to the depreciation of the leased vehicles on a straightline basis over the term of the individual leases cost of automotive sales related to leased vehicles was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

the decrease in cost of revenues from automotive sales for the year ended december 31 2010 was partially offset by the increase in cost of revenues from development services cost of development services includes 

  

engineering support and testing direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements during the quarter ended march 31 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs related to this program in cost of revenues 

gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was 307 million an increase from 95 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was driven primarily by the gross profit contributed by our development services revenues which we began to recognize in 2010 an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers the continued launch of the tesla roadster internationally where in certain markets we have experienced higher selling prices and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster 2 during the second half of 2009 gross profit for the year ended december 31 2010 was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the aclass development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended december 31 2010 did not have any corresponding cost of revenues since these costs were recorded in research and development expenses prior to us finalizing the development agreement in may 2010 

cost of revenues of 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from 159 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the significant increase in cost of revenues was due to the increase in tesla roadster sales from which we began to recognize revenue during the fourth quarter of 2008 higher warranty expense and the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster 2 as well as significant part changes implemented to improve the design and reduce per unit costs for which we recorded charges to cost of revenues in the amount of 14 million for excess and obsolete inventory during the year ended december 31 2009 

gross loss for the year ended december 31 2008 was 11 million due to the lower average selling prices for our initial vehicles the high materials and manufacturing costs associated with our first generation tesla roadster and limited economies of scale from low vehicle production volumes gross profit for the year ended december 31 2009 of 95 million benefited from higher per unit revenue and reduced manufacturing cost from increased volume and component redesign 

we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria this may cause our gross profit and gross margin to be similarly impacted 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research supply chain quality manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur if any prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 

research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 930 million an increase from 193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 included 232 million in daimler smart fortwo development compensation which was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses the 737 million increase in research and 

  

development expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 250 million increase in employee cash and stockbased compensation expenses primarily associated with significantly higher headcount to support our model s and powertrain development activities the 232 million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 a 105 million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha build as well as powertrain development activities a 107 million increase in professional and outside services costs related to model s engineering design and testing activities and a 16 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including our transition to our palo alto headquarters 

during the first quarter of 2010 daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its aclass electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during 2011 as of march 31 2010 a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such the related development services costs of 05 million that we incurred during the quarter ended march 31 2010 were expensed in research and development in may 2010 we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs associated with this program in cost of revenues 

research and development expenses of 193 million for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from 537 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 344 million decrease in research and development expenses was a result of the 232 million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 a 133 million decrease resulting from the allocation of various manufacturingrelated costs to inventory and cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production a 32 million decrease in charges related to excess and obsolescence adverse purchase commitments and materials and tooling expense due both to the classification of productionrelated costs to cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production as well as lower outside professional services partially offset by a 55 million increase in employee compensation expenses associated with higher headcount for the year ended december 31 2009 

we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december 31 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time upon entering into the final agreement in may 2009 we began recognizing as an offset to our research and development expenses the deferred development compensation of 145 million on a straightline basis this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement beginning in may 2009 and continuing through november 2009 payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may 2009 were recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones we did not recognize any development compensation from daimler during the year ended december 31 2008 

since the commercial launch of the tesla roadster our investment in related research and development has decreased significantly we have however significantly increased our research and development efforts for the model s which has resulted in an increase in our research and development expenses in both aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of our revenues we anticipate that this trend will continue on an annual basis as we incur additional costs to develop the model s and to operate our planned model s manufacturing facility in fremont california prior to the start of model s production 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores marketing sales executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 were 846 million an increase from 422 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 424 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 consisted primarily of a 158 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards expense related to performancebased awards an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants made in 2010 and the 24 million correction of additional stockbased compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2009 a 134 million increase in employee cash compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support a larger number of stores in the united states and europe and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business a 71 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated costs to support the growth of our business including the opening of new stores and service locations and our transition to our palo alto headquarters a 32 million increase in travel and expenses related to our sales and marketing activities and a 10 million increase in professional services costs related to ongoing trademark and patent work recruiting as well as general corporate development activities 

selling general and administrative expenses of 422 million for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from 236 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 186 million increase in our selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 consisted primarily of an 84 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support our opening of additional stores in the united states and europe as well as higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business and our efforts to become a public company a 47 million increase in office information technology and facilities costs to support the growth of our business including the opening of new stores a 20 million increase in legal services and legal settlements and accounting and other consulting services to support our growth and a 13 million increase in costs principally related to increased marketing activities 

we expect selling general and administrative expenses to increase both in aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations increase our sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and prepare for the planned model s commercial launch in mid2012 and as we support the requirements of being a public company we also expect an increase in our selling general and administrative expenses as a result of our planned increase in the number of tesla stores as of december 31 2010 we had opened tesla stores in the united states europe and japan we plan to open additional stores during 2011 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 10 million a decrease from 25 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily related to our convertible notes which were converted into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may 2009 while interest expense during the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in 2010 during the year ended december 31 2010 we capitalized 08 million of interest expense to assets under construction 

interest expense of 25 million for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from 37 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in interest expense was due to the conversion of our convertible notes into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may 2009 

we expect interest expense to increase as we continue to draw down on the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities 

  

other expense net 

other expense net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our warrant liabilities and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities we expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates income or charges resulting from the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability excluding the doe warrant liability was eliminated after july 2 2010 as these warrants were net exercised at the completion of our ipo the doe convertible preferred stock warrant which we issued in january 2010 became a common stock warrant on july 2 and is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense net until its expiration or vesting 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 was 66 million an increase in expense compared to other expense net of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily due to the fair value changes in our warrant liabilities as well as the liability related to common stock warrants to certain of our stockholders which we issued in may 2010 both of which increased significantly in conjunction with the increase in our common stock valuation 

other expense net for the year ended december 31 2009 increased from 10 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was primarily a result of a 18 million increase in foreign currency transaction losses associated with a higher level of foreign currency denominated purchases as well as the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar partially offset by a 16 million decrease in the fair value change of our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants during the year ended december 31 2009 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 was 02 million an increase from the provision for income taxes of 26000 during the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was due primarily to the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july 2009 and the ensuing increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions in subsequent periods additionally during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized research and development benefits from our foreign operations which decreased our provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from the provision for income taxes of 01 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was due primarily to the research and development benefits that we recognized in 2009 from our foreign operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2010 we had 5664 million principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility this includes cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 996 million which included investments in money market funds cash of 736 million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility and 3932 million available under the doe loan facility which is primarily intended to cover spending related to the development of the model s and our powertrain activities 

our primary source of cash historically has been proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes and through december 31 2009 we had raised an aggregate of 3192 million from convertible preferred stock and convertible note financings during the year ended december 31 2010 we entered into our 4650 million doe loan facility from which we have begun to make draw downs as well as completing our ipo and private placements with toyota and panasonic other sources of cash have also included reservation payments from customers for the tesla roadster and more recently from sales of the tesla roadster 

  

cash from the provision of electric powertrain development services sales of powertrain components draw downs from the doe loan facility and refundable reservation payments for our model s 

we expect that our current sources of liquidity including cash cash equivalents cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility together with our anticipated cash from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations through the anticipated initial customer deliveries of the model s this capital will fund our ongoing operations continue research development and design efforts establish sales and service centers improve infrastructure such as expanded battery assembly facilities and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce the model s the acceleration of the development of future vehicles investments in new technologies increased insourcing of manufacturing capabilities investments to expand our powertrain activities or further expand our sales and service network may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit we may also choose to opportunistically raise additional funds if market conditions are favorable we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 

doe loan facility 

on january 20 2010 we entered into our doe loan facility for 4650 million to support the expansion of our manufacturing operations up to an aggregate principal amount of 1012 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithiumion battery packs electric motors and electric components or the powertrain facility up to an aggregate principal amount of 3639 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 915 of the costs eligible for funding for the development of and to build out the manufacturing facility for our model s sedan or the model s facility our obligations for the development of and the buildout of our manufacturing facility for the model s is budgeted to be an aggregate of 33 million or approximately 85 of the ongoing budgeted cost plus any cost overruns for the projects 

our ability to draw down funds under the doe loan facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions we are currently in compliance with these draw conditions for the powertrain facility the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components for the model s facility the remaining draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the model s and the planned model s manufacturing facility certain advances will be subject to additional conditions to drawdown related to the site on which the applicable project is located we are currently progressing towards our milestones additionally the doe loan facility provides for the ability to update milestones should a reasonable need arise loans may be requested under the facilities until january 22 2013 and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date 

through december 31 2010 we had received loans under the doe loan facility for an aggregate of 718 million with interest rates ranging from 17 to 34 in february 2011 we received additional loans under the doe loan facility for 156 million at interest rates ranging from 26 to 30 interest on advances under the doe loan facility is payable quarterly in arrears advances under the powertrain facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on december 15 2012 or for advances made after such date in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing on june 15 2013 all outstanding amounts under the powertrain facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of september 15 2019 advances under the model s facility are repayable in 40 equal quarterly installments commencing on december 15 2012 or for advances made after such date in 38 equal quarterly installments commencing on june 15 2013 all outstanding amounts under the model s facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of september 15 2022 advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time all obligations under the doe loan facility are secured by substantially all of our property

panasonic private placement 

in november 2010 we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an entity affiliated with panasonic corporation panasonic pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 1418573 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds of 300 million 

  

leasing activities 

in february 2010 we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster through our wholly owned subsidiary tesla motors leasing inc qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for 36 months after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value 

when compared to our sales of vehicles our leasing activities will spread the cash inflows that we would otherwise receive upon the sale of a vehicle over the lease term and final disposition of the leased vehicle as such our cash and working capital requirements will be directly impacted and if leasing volume increases significantly the impact may be material however after taking into consideration our current and planned sources of operating cash our ability to monitor and prospectively adjust our leasing activity as well as our intent to collect nonrefundable deposits for leased vehicles that are manufactured to specification we do not believe that our planned leasing operations will materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments and obligations as they become due as we will also be exposed to credit risk related to the timely collection of lease payments from our customers we intend to utilize our credit approval and ongoing review processes in order to minimize any credit losses that could occur and which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we intend to require deposits from customers electing a lease option for vehicles built to a customer’s specifications on the same timeframe and under the same circumstances as from customers purchasing our vehicles outright during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 14 of the vehicles delivered during the period were under operating leases as of december 31 2010 we had deferred revenues of 11 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases through december 31 2010 our leasing activity has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity 

reservation payments 

a source of our cash flows from operations has been through our receipt of reservation payments from our customers reservation payments consist of reservation payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a tesla roadster or model s for our 2010 model year tesla roadsters manufactured to specification our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the country of purchase for the model s we require an initial reservation payment of at least 5000 for vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms no deposit is required prior to the second quarter of 2010 our reservation policy was to accept reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a tesla roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications during the second quarter of 2010 we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for tesla roadsters manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement however we also occasionally accept reservation payments for the tesla roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications for customers who have placed a reservation payment with us the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement the full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle is required only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer we do not believe that these changes will materially impact our liquidity or capital resources reservation payments for a vehicle are recorded as a current liability when received no later than upon the delivery of a vehicle the reservation payments collected on a customer’s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle reservation payments are expected to fluctuate as the number of reservation holders on the tesla roadster reservation list decreases while the number of reservation holders on the model s reservation list increases 

  

summary of cash flows 

 

 cash flows from operating activities 

we continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the united states and internationally since inception we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately 3306 million of cash in operations through december 31 2010 our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory personnel related expenditures accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities 

net cash used in operating activities was 1278 million during the year ended december 31 2010 the largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of 1543 million which included noncash charges of 212 million related to stockbased compensation expense 106 million related to depreciation and amortization and 50 million related to the fair value change in our warrant liabilities significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1776 million of operating expenses 860 million of cost of revenues a 201 million increase in inventory an 84 million increase in operating lease vehicles and a 50 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 133 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 35 million increase in other longterm liabilities inventory increased to meet our production requirements for the tesla roadster and powertrain component sales while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business as well as our increased manufacturing and model s development activities operating lease vehicles increased with the introduction of our leasing program in 2010 other longterm liabilities increased as a result of higher warranty liability from sales of the tesla roadster 

significant operating cash inflows for the year ended december 31 2010 were derived primarily from automotive sales of 971 million 197 million of development services revenue a 48 million increase in deferred revenues and a 47 million increase in reservation payments partially offset by a 32 million increase in accounts receivable in october 2010 we entered into a phase 1 contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system including a battery power electronics module motor gearbox and associated software which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav4 upon execution of the agreement we received a 50 million upfront payment for which revenue is being recognized over the expected term of our performance deferred revenues also increased from our vehicle leasing activities as we are recognizing the lease downpayments over the term of the operating leases the increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to daimler’s smart fortwo program as well as 23 million receivable from toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the phase 1 contract services agreement during the year ended december 31 2010 we received 104 million of net new reservation payments for the model s while reservation payments for the tesla roadster decreased by 57 million 

net cash used in operating activities was 808 million during the year ended december 31 2009 the largest component of our cash used during this year was the 557 million net loss which included noncash charges of 69 million related to depreciation and amortization 27 million related to interest on convertible notes and 14 million related to inventory writedowns as well as a noncash gain of 15 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to 1024 million of cost of revenues 614 million of operating expenses a 79 million increase in inventory and 

  

a 20 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a 34 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 09 million increase in accounts payable inventory increased to meet our production requirements while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflect a higher level of annual operating costs such as insurance licenses and taxes from the growth of the business the increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were also primarily due to the growth in our business 

significant operating cash inflows for the year ended december 31 2009 were derived primarily from the sales of the tesla roadster as well as development compensation related to the daimler development agreement cash inflows related to automotive sales activity were 885 million comprised of 1119 million of automotive sales partially offset by a 220 million decrease in refundable reservation payments and a 15 million decrease in deferred revenues the decrease in the refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the tesla roadster during the year ended december 31 2008 as we continued to deliver the tesla roadster to our customers in 2009 we applied the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost cash inflows from the daimler development agreement were 132 million comprised primarily of 232 million of development compensation partially offset by a 100 million decrease in deferred development compensation the decrease in deferred development compensation was the result of the amortization of deferred development compensation that we received during the year ended december 31 2008 

net cash used in operating activities was 524 million during the year ended december 31 2008 the largest component of our cash used during this period was the 828 million net loss which included noncash charges of 43 million related to inventory writedowns 42 million related to depreciation and amortization 37 million related to interest on convertible notes and 28 million related to the fair value change in our convertible preferred stock warrant liability as well as a noncash gain of 12 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants significant operating cash outflows were driven primarily by 774 million of operating expenses 159 million of cost of sales and an 188 million increase in inventory partially offset by an 88 million increase in accounts payable and a 26 million increase in accrued liabilities we had increased inventory in anticipation of the commercial introduction of the tesla roadster accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased primarily due to the significant increase in activities to bring the tesla roadster to production

cash flows from investing activities 

we continue to experience negative cash flows from investing activities as we expand our business build our infrastructure both in the united states and internationally and develop our model s manufacturing capabilities cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations including investments in model s manufacturing as well as restricted cash that we must maintain in relation to our doe loan facility facility lease agreements equipment financing and certain vendor credit policies 

net cash used in investing activities was 1803 million during the year ended december 31 2010 primarily related to capital purchases of 1054 million and a net increase in restricted cash of 749 million the increase 

  

in capital purchases was driven primarily by 652 million of payments made in relation to our purchase of the manufacturing facility located in fremont california from nummi and certain manufacturing assets located thereon to be used for our planned model s manufacturing as well as 402 million primarily related to other model s capital expenditures our transition to and build out of our powertrain manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters in palo alto california and purchases of manufacturing equipment our purchase transactions with nummi were completed in october 2010 the increase in restricted cash was primarily related to 1000 million of net proceeds from our ipo and concurrent toyota private placement that we transferred to a dedicated account as required by our doe loan facility partially offset by 264 million that was transferred out of the dedicated account during the third and fourth quarters of 2010 in accordance with the provisions of the doe loan facility 

net cash used in investing activities was 142 million during the year ended december 31 2009 primarily related to capital purchases of 119 million and an increase in restricted cash of 24 million the increase in restricted cash was primarily related to standard credit policies required by our online payment vendor and security deposits related to lease agreements and equipment financing 

net cash used in investing activities was 116 million during the year ended december 31 2008 primarily related to capital purchases of 106 million and an increase in restricted cash of 10 million 

net cash used in investing activities is expected to increase substantially in 2011 as we build out and tool our model s manufacturing facility in fremont california and our powertrain manufacturing facility in palo alto california we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of 190 million to 215 million during 2011 

cash flows from financing activities 

we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of 2968 million on a cumulative basis through december 31 2009 from loans under the doe loan facility beginning in 2010 and more recently from the net proceeds from our ipo and private placements 

cash provided by financing activities was 3380 million during the year ended december 31 2010 comprised primarily of 1888 million in proceeds from our ipo 718 million we received from our loans under the doe loan facility 500 million in proceeds from the toyota private placement 300 million in proceeds from the panasonic private placement partially offset by 37 million of issuance costs we incurred in relation to our doe loan facility and our ipo

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of december 31 2010 certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity in thousands 

 

  

 in october 2010 we completed the purchase of our fremont california manufacturing facility from nummi nummi has previously identified environmental conditions at the fremont site which affect soil and groundwater and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions although we have been advised by nummi that it has documented and managed the environmental issues we cannot determine with certainty the potential costs to remediate any preexisting contamination based on management’s best estimate we estimated the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be 53 million which is not reflected in the table above as the timing of any potential payments cannot be reasonably determined at this time as nummi continues with its decommissioning activities and as we continue with our planned construction and operating activities it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially
