critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices “ssps” because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining estimated ssps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s ssps and the future rate of related amortization for productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company invests in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm agreements to secure the supply of inventory the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturingrelated assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record writedowns or impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees

income taxes 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greaterthan50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices “ssps” because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining estimated ssps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s ssps and the future rate of related amortization for productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided

warranty costs 

the company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the company’s hardware products the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required 

income taxes 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greaterthan50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the company’s effective tax rate for 2018  was lower than the 2018 blended us tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the act 

the company’s effective tax rates for 2017  and 2016  were lower than the historical statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no us taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

the lower effective tax rate in 2018  compared to 2017  was due primarily to the lower 2018 blended us tax rate partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the act the lower effective tax rate in 2017  compared to 2016  was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher us rd tax credits 

as a result of adopting accounting standards update “asu” no 201609 compensation – stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  “asu 201609” in 2018 the company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes the company anticipates that these excess tax benefits or deficiencies will have the greatest impact on its effective tax rates in the first and third quarters as the majority of the company’s equity awards vest in those quarters 

as of september 29 2018  the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 63 billion  and deferred tax liabilities of 426 million  management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 

on august 30 2016 the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the “state aid decision” the state aid decision ordered ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014 the recovery amount was calculated to be €131 billion  plus interest of €12 billion  irish legislative changes effective as of january 2015 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union ireland has also appealed the state aid decision the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against us taxes subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the act as of september 29 2018  the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals 

on july 24 2018 the us ninth circuit court of appeals reversed the us tax courts decision in altera corp v commissioner  regarding the inclusion of sharebased compensation in costsharing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries the reversal was subsequently withdrawn and the company believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from the final resolution of the case

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit for payment terms in excess of the company’s standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industryspecific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of iphone ipad mac and certain other products the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the company’s esps is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided

inventory valuation valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory the company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends if the company determines inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value it records a writedown of the inventories the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value any writedowns andor impairments the company may be required to record would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days  if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results 

warranty costs 

the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  34 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the company’s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the act which significantly changed us tax law the act lowered the company’s us statutory federal income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the impact of the act increased the company’s provision for income taxes by 15 billion  during 2018 this increase was composed of 20 billion  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and 12 billion  associated with the deemed repatriation tax partially offset by a 17 billion  impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the company’s unrecognized tax benefits certain amounts reported by the company related to the act are provisional estimates in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 resolution of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the company’s effective tax rates for 2016  2015  and 2014  differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no us taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us the lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater rd tax credits the higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes

the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory andor impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or inventory prepayments these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturingrelated assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional writedowns were recorded

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

as of september 26 2015 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 78 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 241 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 

the us internal revenue service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012 and all years prior to 2010 are closed in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities in major states and major foreign jurisdictions the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 

on june 11 2014 the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the company the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the company believes the european commission’s assertions are without merit if the european commission were to conclude against ireland the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid while such amount could be material as of september 26 2015 the company is unable to estimate the impact

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors

inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory andor manufacturingrelated assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturingrelated assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results in the period when the writedowns were recorded

the company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory inventory prepayments andor manufacturingrelated capital assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded

warranty costs

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

 the gross margin percentage in 2013 was 376 compared to 439 in 2012 the yearoveryear decrease in gross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins introduction of ipad mini with gross margin significantly below the company’s average product margins higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the company’s service policies and other 

  

warranty costs price reductions on certain products including ipad 2 and iphone 4 and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations 

the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 439 compared to 405 in 2011 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 459 compared to 414 during the second half of 2012 the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales additionally gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers price reductions on certain existing products higher transition costs associated with product launches and continued strengthening of the us dollar partially offset by lower commodity costs 

the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2014 to be between 365 and 375 the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014 is forwardlooking and could differ from actual results the company’s future gross margin can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth above in part i item 1a of this form 10k under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the us dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for 2013 2012 and 2011 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

 research and development “rd” expense

services the growth in sga during 2012 was primarily due to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment increased headcount and related expenses higher spending on professional services marketing and advertising programs and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company’s net sales 

other income and expense 

other income and expense for 2013 2012 and 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 the yearoveryear increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and remeasurement losses from foreign exchange rate movements the overall increase in other income and expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher interest and dividend income on the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 103 during 2013 and 2012 and 077 during 2011 the company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and 2011 and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense 

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2013 2012 and 2011 are as follows in millions

inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory inventory prepayments andor manufacturingrelated capital assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products if the company’s product development plans change or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates 

  

these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a 

  

valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 7 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

gross margin 

gross margin for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 439 compared to 405 in 2011 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 459 compared to 414 during the second half of 2012 the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales additionally gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers price reductions on certain existing products higher transition costs associated with product launches and continued strengthening of the us dollar partially offset by lower commodity costs 

the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 405 compared to 394 in 2010 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs 

the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2012 and the company anticipates gross margin of about 36 during the first quarter of 2013 expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases future strengthening of the us dollar could further negatively impact gross margin 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in future periods including the first quarter of 2013 are forwardlooking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including but not limited to those set forth above in part i item 1a of this form 10k under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

  

operating expenses 

operating expenses for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

 research and development “rd” expense 

rd expense increased 952 million or 39 in 2012 compared to 2011 and 647 million or 36 in 2011 compared to 2010 the growth in rd expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded rd activities although total rd expense increased 39 and 36 in 2012 and 2011 respectively it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales 

the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense 

sga expense increased 24 billion or 32 during 2012 compared to 2011 and 21 billion or 38 during 2011 compared to 2010 these increases were primarily due to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment increased headcount and related expenses higher spending on professional services marketing and advertising programs and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company’s net sales

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were approximately 252 242 and 244 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 

  

35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

as of september 29 2012 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 40 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 149 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009 all irs audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of iphone ipad apple tv for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010 and for sales of mac beginning in june 2011 the company has indicated it may from timetotime provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers in june 2011 the company announced it would begin providing various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices which range from 24 to 48 months the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment the company’s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services or the estimated lives of the related devices or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors the company’s esp for software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change if the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also change 

  

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to 

  

record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

gross margin 

gross margin for the three years ended september 24 2011 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 405 compared to 394 in 2010 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs 

the gross margin percentage in 2010 was 394 compared to 401 in 2009 this yearoveryear decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to new products that had higher cost structures including ipad partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone which had a higher gross margin than the company average 

the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2011 largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and potential future component cost and other cost increases 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage are forwardlooking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i item 1a “risk factors” under the subheading “ future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities ” which is incorporated herein by reference in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to these competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates

rd expense increased 34 or 449 million to 18 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded rd activities also contributing to this increase in rd expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of 71 million related to mac os x snow leopard although total rd expense increased 34 during 2010 it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52 yearoveryear increase in net sales in 2010

the company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified thirdparty however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of its operating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september 24 2011 or september 25 2010 

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

  

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of marketable securities allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products eg mac computers iphones ipods and peripherals software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product’s essential software the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” 

for iphone the company indicated it might from timetotime provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers the company has identified two deliverables generally contained in arrangements involving the sale of iphone the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of iphone to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product’s essential software the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the two deliverables the allocation of revenue has been based on the company’s esps amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the 24month estimated life of the related hardware all product cost of sales including estimated warranty costs are generally recognized at the time of sale costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred if the estimated life of the hardware product should change the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change 

for all periods presented the company’s esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold is 25 the company’s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe involves management’s judgment the company’s process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable the company believes its customers particularly 

  

consumers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone this view is primarily based on the fact that upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered in the future therefore the company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis such as those included with iphone the selling price would be relatively low key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for iphone upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings the company’s historical pricing practices the nature of the upgrade rights eg unspecified and whenandifavailable and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors the company’s esp for software upgrades related to future iphone sales could change in future periods if the company’s esp for the unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone had been 5 or 20 higher or lower the company’s net sales for the year ended september 26 2009 would have decreased or increased by 50 million as compared to the company’s net sales of 429 billion 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax as reported in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of investments impact the company’s net income only when such investments are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired or not could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty distributors cellular network carriers and resellers and directly to certain education consumer and enterprise customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk in addition when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe asia and australia or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or creditrisksharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the creditworthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect its results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual 

  

product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered the number of updates expected to occur and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with gaap the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap whereby the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” in notes to consolidated financial statements the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with gaap the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in management’s opinion the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results however the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

americas 

during 2009 net sales in the americas segment increased 24 billion or 15 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant yearoveryear increase in iphone revenue higher sales of thirdparty digital content and applications from the itunes store and increased sales of mac portable systems which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of mac desktop systems and ipods americas mac net sales decreased 6 due primarily to lower average selling prices while mac unit sales increased by 4 on a yearoveryear basis the increase in mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 the americas segment represented approximately 44 of the company’s total net sales in both 2009 and 2008 

during 2008 net sales in the americas segment increased 45 billion or 38 compared to 2007 the primary drivers of this growth were the significant yearoveryear increase in sales of iphone ipod touch mac portable systems and content from the itunes store the company began shipping iphone in june 2007 and the growth in iphone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iphone shipments as well as stronger demand for iphones in the fourth quarter of 2008 the increase in mac net sales of 14 billion or 31 and mac unit sales of 961 million or 32 is attributable to growth in sales of all of the mac portable systems particularly the macbook and higher sales of the imac net sales of ipods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced ipods particularly the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 in 2008 the americas segment represented 44 of the company’s total net sales as compared to 48 in 2007 

europe 

during 2009 net sales in europe increased 26 billion or 28 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iphone revenue and strong sales of mac portable systems offset partially by lower net sales of mac desktop systems ipods and a stronger us dollar mac unit sales increased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 which was driven primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems particularly macbook pro while total mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products although ipod net sales decreased in europe yearoveryear as a result of lower average selling prices ipod unit sales increased due to ipod touch and market share increases the europe segment represented 28 and 25 of total net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

europe’s net sales increased 38 billion or 69 during 2008 compared to 2007 the main drivers of this growth were strong sales of iphone mac portable systems and imac and increased sales from the itunes store also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher ipod net sales due primarily to the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 sales of mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the macbook pro and the macbook both updated in february 2008 as well as sales of the macbook air introduced in january 2008 mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the imac which was updated in april 2008 the europe segment represented 25 and 22 of total net sales in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

japan 

japan’s net sales increased 551 million or 32 in 2009 compared to 2008 the key contributors to this growth were increased iphone revenue stronger demand for certain mac portable systems and ipods and strength in the japanese yen partially offset by decreased sales of mac desktop systems net sales and unit sales of mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano 

  

japan net sales increased 644 million or 59 in 2008 compared to 2007 the primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iphones ipods imac mac portable systems and strong sales from the itunes store net sales unit sales and the average selling price of ipods increased during 2008 compared to 2007 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano additionally mac net sales and unit sales grew 42 and 29 respectively in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of imac and mac portable systems particularly macbook as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008 

retail 

retail net sales decreased 636 million or 9 during 2009 compared to 2008 the decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iphones ipods and mac desktop systems offset partially by strong demand for mac portable systems the company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009 including a total of 14 international stores ending the year with 273 stores open this compares to 247 stores open as of september 27 2008 and 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 

the yearoveryear decline in retail net sales is attributable to continued thirdparty channel expansion particularly in the us where most of the company’s stores are located and also reflects the challenging consumerspending environment with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008 respectively average revenue per store decreased to 262 million for 2009 from 346 million in 2008 

the retail segment’s net sales grew by 29 billion or 67 during 2008 compared to 2007 due in large part to strong demand for the iphone increased sales of mac portable and desktop systems increased sales of ipod touch and new store openings the company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008 bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27 2008 this compares to 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007 respectively average revenue per store increased to 346 million for 2008 from 245 million in 2007 

as measured by the company’s operating segment reporting the retail segment reported operating income of 17 billion during 2009 and 2008 and 876 million during 2007 despite the yearoveryear decline in retail net sales the retail segment’s operating income was flat at 17 billion in 2009 and 2008 due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced by the overall company the retail segment’s operating income increased by 785 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant retail net sales growth of 67 as compared to 2007 

expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure operating lease commitments personnel and other operating expenses capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were 369 million in 2009 bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the retail segment to 18 billion as of september 26 2009 the retail segment had approximately 16500 fulltime equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of 15 billion the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

other segments 

the company’s other segments which consist of its asia pacific and filemaker operations experienced an increase in net sales of 482 million or 17 during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac portable systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to ipods and mac desktop systems in the asia pacific region as well as a strengthening of the us dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies mac net sales and unit sales grew in the asia pacific region by 4 and 17 respectively due to increased sales of the macbook pro 

  

the company’s other segments experienced an increase in net sales of 10 billion or 59 during 2008 as compared to 2007 these increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of iphone mac portable systems ipods and imac in the company’s asia pacific region sales from the itunes store in the company’s asia pacific region grew 109 compared to 2007

the gross margin percentage in 2008 was 352 compared to 332 in 2007 the primary contributors of the increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity costs which were partially offset by higher other product costs in 2007 gross margin was impacted by higher than expected costs associated with the initial iphone product launch

 research and development “rd” 

rd expenditures increased 20 or 224 million to 13 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in the current year to support expanded rd activities and higher stockbased compensation expenses in addition 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from rd expense during 2009 compared to 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 although total rd expense increased 20 during 2009 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14 increase in revenue in 2009 the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive

from rd expense while rd expense for 2007 excluded 75 million of capitalized software development costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone software although total rd expense increased 42 during 2008 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 53 increase in revenue during 2008 

selling general and administrative expense “sga” 

sga expenditures increased 388 million or 10 to 41 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases are due primarily to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets higher stockbased compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising 

expenditures for sga increased 798 million or 27 to 38 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases are due primarily to higher stockbased compensation expenses higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant yearoveryear increase in total net sales and the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets in addition the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007 

other income and expense 

other income and expense for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions 

 

 total other income and expense decreased 294 million or 47 to 326 million during 2009 compared to 620 million and 599 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 partially offset by the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 143 344 and 527 during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense 

the company’s investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of 16 million and 121 million as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively which were offset by gross unrealized gains of 73 million and 4 million as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively the net unrealized gains as of september 26 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of september 27 2008 related primarily to longterm marketable securities the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature the unrealized losses on the company’s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates specifically widening credit spreads the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not the company will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis accordingly no material declines in fair value were recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of operations during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009 2008 and 2007 related to such sales 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were 32 32 and 30 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

  

as of september 26 2009 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 19 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of 28 billion for presentation on the company’s consolidated balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs

as of september 26 2009 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 971 million and an additional 291 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between 105 million and 145 million in the next 12 months at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the company’s financial condition or operating results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of marketable securities allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software thirdparty digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue for software products operating system software and applications software or any product that is considered to be softwarerelated in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions eg mac computers iphones and ipod portable digital music and video players for products that are not software or softwarerelated eg thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac iphone and ipod supplies and accessories the company recognizes revenue pursuant to various revenuerelated gaap as described below 

the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not or is presumed not to be fixed or determinable revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

for both iphone and apple tv the company has indicated it may from timetotime provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers accordingly iphone handsets and apple tv sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with gaap as such the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale and are both recognized on a straightline basis over the currently estimated 24month economic lives of these products with any loss recognized at the time of sale if the company’s estimated economic life of a product accounted for under subscription accounting changes the 

  

future rate at which deferred revenue and deferred costs are recognized in the company’s results of operations will change costs incurred by the company for engineering sales marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax as reported in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of investments impact the company’s net income only when such investments are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired or not could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty distributors cellular network carriers and resellers and directly to certain education consumer and enterprise customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk in addition when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe asia and australia or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or creditrisksharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

  

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the creditworthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect its results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary for products accounted for under subscription accounting the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered the number of updates expected to occur and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 

  

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with gaap the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap whereby the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in note 8 “commitments and contingencies” in notes to consolidated financial statements the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with gaap the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in management’s opinion the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results however the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

during 2008 net sales in the americas segment increased 30 billion or 26 compared to 2007 the primary drivers of this growth were the significant yearoveryear increase in sales of the ipod touch mac portable systems content from the itunes store and iphone the company began shipping iphone in june 2007 and the growth in iphone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iphone shipments as well as stronger demand for iphones in the fourth quarter of 2008 the increase in mac net sales of 13 billion or 30 and mac unit sales of 961 million or 32 is attributable to growth in sales of all of the mac portable systems particularly the macbook and higher sales of the imac net sales of ipods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced ipods particularly the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 in 2008 the americas segment represented 45 of the company’s total net sales as compared to 48 in the same period of 2007 

europe 

during 2009 net sales in europe increased 17 billion or 23 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iphone revenue and mac portable systems offset partially by lower net sales of mac desktop systems ipods and a stronger us dollar mac unit sales increased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 which was driven primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems particularly macbook pro while total mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products although ipod net sales decreased in europe yearoveryear as a result of lower average selling prices ipod unit sales increased due to ipod touch and market share increases the europe segment represented 26 and 23 of total net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively

japan 

japan’s net sales increased 322 million or 21 in 2009 compared to 2008 the key contributors to this growth were increased iphone revenue stronger demand for certain mac portable systems and ipods and strength in the japanese yen partially offset by decreased sales of mac desktop systems net sales and unit sales of mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano

strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano additionally mac net sales and unit sales grew 42 and 29 respectively in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of imac and mac portable systems particularly macbook as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008 

retail 

retail net sales increased 259 million or 4 during 2009 compared to 2008 the growth in net sales was driven largely by increased iphone revenue and mac portable systems offset partially by a decrease in sales of ipods and mac desktop systems the company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009 including a total of 14 international stores ending the year with 273 stores open this compares to 247 stores open as of september 27 2008 and 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 

the yearoveryear growth rate of retail net sales was less than the increase in the average number of stores open during the same period which the company believes reflects the challenging consumerspending environment and continued thirdparty channel expansion particularly in the us where most of its stores are located with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008 respectively average revenue per store decreased to 259 million for 2009 from 299 million in 2008 

the retail segment’s net sales grew by 53 during 2008 compared to 2007 due in large part to increased sales of mac portable and desktop systems strong demand for the iphone and ipod touch and new store openings the company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008 bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27 2008 this compares to 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007 respectively average revenue per store increased to 299 million for 2008 from 231 million in 2007 

as measured by the company’s operating segment reporting the retail segment reported operating income of 14 billion during 2009 as compared to operating income of 13 billion and 875 million during 2008 and 2007 respectively this increase in operating income in 2009 was driven by increased total retail net sales attributable to a 20 increase in average stores open and higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced companywide the retail segment’s operating income increased by 462 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant retail net sales growth of 53 as compared to 2007 

expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure operating lease commitments personnel and other operating expenses capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were 369 million in 2009 bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the retail segment to 18 billion as of september 26 2009 the retail segment had approximately 16500 fulltime equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of 15 billion the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

other segments 

the company’s other segments which consist of its asia pacific and filemaker operations experienced an increase in net sales of 165 million or 7 during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac portable systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to ipods and mac desktop systems in the asia pacific region as well as a strengthening of the us dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies mac net sales and unit sales grew in the asia pacific region by 4 and 17 respectively due to increased sales of the macbook pro 

the company’s other segments experienced an increase in net sales of 707 million or 40 during 2008 as compared to 2007 these increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all mac portable systems 

  

ipods the imac and content from the itunes store in the company’s asia pacific region sales from the itunes store in the company’s asia pacific region grew 109 compared to 2007 

gross margin 

gross margin for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 the gross margin percentage in 2009 was 360 compared to 343 in 2008 the primary drivers of the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were significantly lower commodity and other product costs and a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins which were partially offset by product price reductions gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 

the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2009 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 34 in the first quarter of 2010 this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and both expected and potential future cost increases for key components 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage are forwardlooking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i item 1a “risk factors” under the subheading “ future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities ” which is incorporated herein by reference there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” and liquid crystal displays “lcds” as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to these competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

   

research and development “rd” 

rd expenditures increased 20 or 224 million to 13 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount and higher stockbased compensation expenses in the current year to support expanded rd activities in addition 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from rd expense during 2009 compared to 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 although total rd expense increased 20 during 2009 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 12 increase in revenue in 2009 the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive 

expenditures for rd increased 42 or 327 million to 11 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stockbased compensation expenses in 2008 11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from rd expense while rd expense for 2007 excluded 75 million of capitalized software development costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone software although total rd expense increased 42 during 2008 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35 increase in revenue during 2008 

selling general and administrative expense “sga” 

sga expenditures increased 388 million or 10 to 41 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases are due primarily to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets higher stockbased compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising 

expenditures for sga increased 798 million or 27 to 38 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases are due primarily to higher stockbased compensation expenses higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant yearoveryear increase in total net sales and the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets in addition the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007 

other income and expense 

other income and expense for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions 

 

 total other income and expense decreased 294 million or 47 to 326 million during 2009 compared to 620 million and 599 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 partially offset by the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 143 344 and 527 during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense 

the company’s investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of 16 million and 121 million as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively which were offset by gross unrealized gains of 73 million and 4 million as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively the net unrealized gains 

  

as of september 26 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of september 27 2008 related primarily to longterm marketable securities the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature the unrealized losses on the company’s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates specifically widening credit spreads the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not the company will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis accordingly no material declines in fair value were recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of operations during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009 2008 and 2007 related to such sales 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were 29 30 and 30 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

as of september 26 2009 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 32 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of 18 billion for presentation on the company’s consolidated balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards boards “fasb” amended the accounting standards codification “asc” as summarized in accounting standards update “asu” 200914 software topic 985 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu 200913 revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  as summarized in asu 200914 asc topic 985 has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality as summarized in asu 200913 asc topic 605 has been amended 1 to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 2 to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence of selling price and 3 to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method the accounting changes summarized in asu 200914 and asu 200913 are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 with early adoption permitted adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 

  

the company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the asc on its accounting and reporting systems and processes however at this time the company is unable to quantify the impact on its financial statements of its adoption or determine the timing and method of its adoption as of september 26 2009 total iphone and apple tv deferred revenue and deferred costs were 121 billion and 52 billion respectively the company believes that application of these amendments will result in a substantial portion of the revenue associated with the sale of iphone and apple tv and all related cost of sales being recognized at the time of sale currently revenue and associated cost of sales for these products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the currently estimated 24month economic life of the products

individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the company’s financial condition or operating results

gross margin 

gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september 27 2008 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 gross margin percentage of 340 in 2007 increased significantly from 290 in 2006 the primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components including nand flash memory and dram memory higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the company’s direct sales channels 

the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30 in 2009 this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures both expected and potential future cost increases for key components a stronger us dollar and higher logistical costs 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage are forwardlooking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i item 1a “risk factors” under the subheading “ future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities ” which is incorporated herein by reference there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” and liquid crystal displays “lcds” as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to these competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates

critical accounting policies and estimates

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs and income taxes management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software peripherals digital content and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards including statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition  as amended and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not or is presumed not to be fixed or determinable revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the company has sold the product and committed to the relevant program the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty resellers and directly to certain education consumer and commercial customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe and asia and by arranging with thirdparty financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company’s direct customers these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty flooring arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible  the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the writedowns are recorded 

the company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified 

warranty costs 

the company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 which if implemented by the company would affect the company’s tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made similarly if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable the respective valuation allowance would be reversed resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations and financial position

·   net sales and unit sales of imac systems were down 23 and 16 respectively during 2004 versus 2003 the decrease in imac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new imac based on the powerpc g5 processor primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by ibm the delays in the new imac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old imac flat panel prior to availability of the new imac g5 the old flat panel imac form factor which was available during most of 2004 was nearly 3 years old by the time the new imac g5 began shipping in september 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product the company believes that sales of imac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and desktop models from competitors with price points below 1000

·   net sales and unit sales in the company’s japan segment decreased 3 and 14 respectively during 2004 versus 2003 the company believes these declines related to a shift in sales from the japan segment to the retail segment as a result of the tokyo and osaka store openings in 2004 declines in net sales in japan may have also related to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in japan of certain mac os x native applications such as quark xpress 6 which did not become available until september 2004 when sales from the japan retail stores are included in the results for the japan segment the combined revenue in japan resulted in a 3 yearoveryear increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 see

during 2004 net sales in the americas segment grew 26 or 838 million compared to 2003 the increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant yearoveryear increase in ipod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals software and services this increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the retail segment which had 84 stores in the us as of the end of 2004 macintosh unit sales also increased by 4 in 2004 compared to 2003 driven primarily by strong sales of portable and power macintosh systems partially offset by weakness in imac sales during 2004 and 2003 the americas segment represented approximately 49 and 51 respectively of the company’s total net sales and represented approximately 51 and 54 respectively of total macintosh unit sales the company experienced an increase in us education channel net sales of 19 for 2004 compared to 2003 strong us education net sales for 2004 related primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful backtoschool selling season with strong demand for the company’s portables this strength drove yearoveryear growth in net sales of 40 for the higher education channel during 2004 the company’s k12 net sales grew yearoveryear by 3 during 2004 despite the challenges in the k12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition 

europe 

during 2005 net sales in the europe segment grew 13 billion or 71 from 2004 total macintosh unit sales in europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 47 in 2005 compared to

japan 

japan’s net sales and macintosh unit sales were up 36 and 8 respectively during 2005 compared to 2004 japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products ipod and other music related products and services desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 31 and 41 respectively and ipod sales increased by 220 during 2005 compared to 2004 the overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004 which the company believes might be attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the new imac g5 and mac mini and a shift to the retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in japan during 2005 

japan’s net sales and macintosh unit sales were down 3 and 14 respectively during 2004 compared to 2003 which lagged behind all of the company’s other operating segments these decreases in net sales and unit sales were believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the japan segment to the retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in japan in 2004 in addition such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of quark xpress 6 for mac os x which did not occur until september 2004 the decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong ipod and ibook sales during 2004 compared to 2003 

retail 

the company opened 38 new retail stores during 2005 including 6 international stores in the uk japan and canada bringing the total number of open stores to 124 as of september 24 2005 this compares to 86 open stores as of september 25 2004 and 65 open stores as of september 27 2003 

net sales of the retail segment grew to 24 billion during 2005 from 12 billion and 621 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the increases in net sales during both 2005 and 2004 reflect the impact of new store openings for each year including the opening of 38 new stores in 2005 and 21 new stores in 2004 an increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segment’s strong sales in 2005 with an average of 105 stores open during 2005 the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately 224 million as compared to 156 million in 2004 with a 76 store average and 115 million in 2003 with a 54 store average 

as measured by the company’s operating segment reporting the retail segment reported operating income of 151 million during 2005 as compared to operating income of 39 million during 2004 and an operating loss of 5 million during 2003 this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment’s yearoveryear increase in average revenue per store the impact of opening new stores and the segment’s yearoveryear increase in net sales which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy depreciation and other fixed costs 

expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure operating lease commitments personnel and other operating expenses capital expenditures associated with the retail segment were 132 million in 2005 bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the retail segment to approximately 529 million as of september 24 2005 the retail segment had approximately 3673 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately 606 million the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

gross margin 

gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

  

gross margin increased in 2005 to 290 of net sales from 273 of net sales in 2004 the company’s gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including lcd flatpanel displays and dram memory an increase in higher margin software sales a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the company’s retail and online stores and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs these increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin ipod sales 

the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure in light of price competition especially for the ipod product line the company expects gross margin percentage to decline in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the ipod and content from the itunes music store 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin are forwardlooking there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved in general gross margins and margins on individual products including ipods will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services and potential changes to the company’s product mix including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins in response to these downward pressures the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments because the company’s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from thirdparties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components the company’s operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

gross margin declined in 2004 to 273 of net sales from 275 of net sales in 2003 the company’s gross margin during 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin ipod and ibook sales pricing actions on certain power macintosh g5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004 higher warranty costs on certain portable macintosh products and higher freight and duty costs during 2004 these unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39 yearoveryear increase in higher margin software sales

total interest and other income net increased 112 million or 211 to 165 million during 2005 compared to 53 million in 2004 and 83 million in 2003 these increases are attributable primarily to increasing investment yields on the company’s cash and shortterm investments and higher invested balances the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased to 270 in 2005 compared to the 138 and 189 rates earned during 2004 and 2003 respectively the company occasionally sells shortterm investments prior to their stated maturities as a result of such sales the company recognized net losses of 137000 in 2005 and net gains of 1 million and 21 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively partially offsetting the increase in other income were higher foreign currency hedging expenses

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate for the year ended september 24 2005 was approximately 26 the company’s effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us research and development tax credits and a reduction of certain tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets the benefit from adjustments to tax contingency reserves and net deferred tax assets was 67 million in addition the company recorded a 25 million reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that in management’s opinion are now more likely than not to be realized in the future 14 million of the valuation allowance reduction was recorded as a credit to income tax expense and the remainder was recorded as a credit to goodwill 

as of september 24 2005 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 767 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the company’s balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets as of september 24 2005 and september 25 2004 a valuation allowance of 5 million and 30 million respectively was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax loss carryforwards that may not be realized the remaining valuation allowance at september 24 2005 relates principally to certain state operating loss carryforwards the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance

factors that may affect future results and financial condition 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

general economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the company’s products and the financial health of its suppliers distributors and resellers 

the company’s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the us and abroad at times in the past demand for the company’s products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions additionally some of the company’s education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the company’s products and related operating results should global andor regional economic conditions deteriorate demand for the company’s products could be adversely affected as could the financial health of its suppliers distributors and resellers 

war terrorism public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply delivery or demand of products which could negatively affect the company’s operations and performance 

war terrorism public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the us or abroad have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy the company and the company’s suppliers or customers the company’s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake other natural disasters fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are located near major seismic faults because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses the company’s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events such events could result in a decrease in demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers and could create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain in addition should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in the availability of freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the company’s operating results and financial condition have been and in the future may be adversely affected by these events 

the market for personal computers and related peripherals and services as well as digital music devices and related services is highly competitive if the company is unable to effectively compete in these markets its results of operations could be adversely affected 

the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors price sensitivity on the part of consumers and a large number of competitors over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell windows and linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products the company’s results of operations and financial condition have been and in the future may continue to be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 

the personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry standards further as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company’s existing products several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company’s key market segments including consumer education professional and consumer digital video editing and design and publishing several of the company’s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products andor online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design technical features and solutions of the company’s products the company has a significant number of competitors many of whom have greater financial marketing manufacturing and technological resources as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company additionally there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the company’s markets 

the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems including windows and linux the company’s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms additionally if unauthorized copies of the mac os are used on other companies’ hardware products and result in decreased demand for the company’s hardware products the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected 

the company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including ipods the company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products including music enabled cell phones distribution services and free peertopeer music services these competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches such as subscription services models and also larger companies that may have greater technical marketing distribution and other resources than those of the company as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the company’s operating results and financial position there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the us the company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices andor increasing features which could adversely affect the company’s music product gross margins as well as overall company gross margins 

the company also faces increased competition in the us education market us elementary and secondary schools as well as college and university customers remain a core market for the company uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers which could negatively affect the company’s market share in an effort to regain market share and remain competitive the company has been and will continue to pursue onetoone 11 learning solutions in education 11 learning solutions typically consist of ibook portable systems for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server these 11 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses particularly for larger deals although the company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the company’s operating results and financial condition 

the company’s transition from powerpc microprocessors used by macintosh computers to microprocessors built by intel is subject to numerous risks 

in june 2005 the company announced its intention to transition from the use of powerpc microprocessors to the use of intel microprocessors in all of its macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007 this transition is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including the company’s ability to timely develop and deliver new products using intel microprocessors the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products including the company’s applications to support intel microprocessors market acceptance of intelbased macintosh computers the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the company to timely deliver intelbased macintosh computers and the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand for both powerpc and intelbased macintosh computers in addition the company is dependent on thirdparty software developers such as microsoft and adobe continuing to support current applications that run on powerpcbased computers and timely developing versions of current and future applications that run on intel and powerpcbased macintosh computers the company’s inability to timely deliver new intelbased products or obtain developer commitment both to continue supporting applications that run on powerpc microprocessors and timely transition their applications to run natively on intelbased products may have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s announcement of its intention to transition to intel microprocessors may negatively impact sales of current and future macintosh products containing powerpc microprocessors as customers may elect to delay purchases until the intelbased products are available additionally there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products including intelbased macintosh computers which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

future operating results are dependent upon the company’s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components including microprocessors some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including microprocessors and asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources some key components including without limitation dram nand flashmemory and tftlcd flatpanel displays while currently available to the company from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide availability and pricing pressures in addition new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers’ yields have matured the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have 

experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company’s requirements if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s ability to produce and market competitive products is dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and freescale semiconductor inc freescale to supply powerpc microprocessors and intel to supply its microprocessors for the company’s macintosh computers and to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with priceperformance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company’s competitors while the company has supply agreements with ibm and freescale the company’s recent announcement of plans to transition to intel microprocessors may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services including powerpc g4 and g5 microprocessors which are essential to the company’s business and are currently obtained by the company from sole or limited sources additionally there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the company’s suppliers to provide advanced powerpc microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the company’s results of operations in addition ibm is currently the company’s sole supplier of the powerpc g5 processor which is used in the company’s current power mac xserve and imac g5 products freescale is the sole supplier of the g4 processor which is used in the company’s emac mac mini and portable products ibm experienced manufacturing problems with the powerpc g5 processor which resulted in the company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 manufacturing problems experienced by any of the company’s suppliers in the future or failure by them to deliver components to the company in sufficient quantities with competitive priceperformance features could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances the company must continually introduce new products and technologies enhance existing products in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the company’s existing products the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions including the transition to intelbased macintosh computers and production ramp issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand including anticipated demand for powerpcbased and intelbased macintosh computers the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 

the company’s products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits 

the company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from thirdparties there can be no assurance that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells 

failure to do so could result in lost revenue loss of reputation and significant warranty and other expense to remedy 

because orders for components and in some cases commitments to purchase components must be placed in advance of customer orders the company faces substantial inventory risk 

the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to intelbased macintosh computers no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges in addition such charges have had and may have a material effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments because the company’s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes and because of the transition to intelbased macintosh computers there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information such purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days the company’s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

the company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties many of whom are located outside of the us 

most of the company’s products are manufactured in whole or in part by thirdparty manufacturers in addition the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions moreover although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise could adversely affect the company’s future operating results and financial condition 

final assembly of products sold by the company is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in cork ireland and by external vendors in fremont california fullerton california taiwan korea the people’s republic of china and the czech republic currently manufacturing of many of the components used in the company’s products is performed by thirdparty vendors in taiwan china japan korea and singapore final assembly of substantially all of the company’s portable products including powerbooks ibooks and ipods is performed by thirdparty vendors in china if for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic business labor environmental public health or political issues as well as information technology system failures or military actions the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the company’s products 

the company distributes its products through wholesalers resellers national and regional retailers and cataloguers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers in addition the company sells many of its products and resells certain thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to end users certain education customers and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores many of the company’s resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by weak economic conditions over the last several years considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners the company’s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company’s products or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products the company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors these programs could require a substantial investment from the company while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment 

over the past several years an increasing proportion of the company’s net sales has been made by the company directly to endusers through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the us canada japan and the uk some of the company’s resellers have perceived this expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products perception of such a conflict could discourage the company’s resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the company’s products the company’s business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to endusers causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the company’s products 

further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i item 1 of this form 10k under the heading “markets and distribution” 

the company relies on thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the company’s itunes music store the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this thirdparty digital content the company’s licensing arrangements with these thirdparty content providers are shortterm in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms if at all certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the itunes music store further some thirdparty content providers currently or may in the future offer music products and services that compete with the company’s music products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their digital content in the future if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the us then sales and gross margins of the company’s itunes music store as well as related hardware and peripherals including ipods may be adversely affected 

thirdparty content providers and artists require that the company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms if the requirements from content providers or artists change then the company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop or license 

such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if at all which could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial position 

the company’s future performance is dependent upon support from thirdparty software developers if thirdparty software applications cease to be developed or available for the company’s hardware products then customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the company’s personal computers as opposed to windowsbased systems are often based on the availability of thirdparty software for particular applications such as microsoft office the company also believes the availability of thirdparty application software for the company’s hardware products depends in part on thirdparty developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products versus software for the larger windows market or growing linux market this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated continued acceptance by customers of mac os x and the costs of developing such software products to the extent the minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the company’s prospects in the personal computer market developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market or growing linux market moreover there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x the company’s operating system on a timely basis or at all 

in june 2005 the company announced its plan to begin using intel microprocessors in its macintosh computers the company plans to begin shipping certain models with intel microprocessors by june 2006 and to complete this transition to intel microprocessors for all of its macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007 the company depends on thirdparty software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on intel and powerpc microprocessors the company’s inability to timely deliver new intelbased products or a decline in available applications that run on the company’s powerpc products or the lack of applications that run on intelbased macintosh systems could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial position 

in addition past and future development by the company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers such as microsoft and adobe to develop maintain and upgrade similar or competitive software for the company’s products the company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals consumers and education customers that could influence the decisions of thirdparty software developers to develop or upgrade macintoshcompatible software products software applications currently marketed by the company include software for professional film and video editing professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions professional music production and music post production professional and consumer dvd encoding and authoring professional digital photo editing and workflow management consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management digital music management desktopbased database management word processing and highquality presentations the company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing page layout image manipulation spreadsheets databases and presentations in a single application discontinuance of thirdparty products for the macintosh platform including microsoft office could have an adverse effect on the company’s net sales and results of operations 

the company’s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties and the company’s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms 

because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others the company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others responding to such claims regardless of their merit can be timeconsuming result in significant expenses and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases however no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a thirdparty the company’s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in part i item 3 of this form 10k in the opinion of management the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition however the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in part i item 3 of this form 10k or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

through october 2005 the company had opened 126 retail stores the company’s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years the majority of which are for 10 years the company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition additionally a relatively high proportion of the retail segment’s costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense as a result significant losses would result should the retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason 

certain of the company’s stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing corporate events and brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the company’s more typical retail stores the company has opened seven such stores through october 2005 because of their location and size these high profile stores also require the company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total 

remaining commitments per location ranging from 4 million to 46 million closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

many of the general risks and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its retail segment also many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond the company’s control that could adversely affect the retail segment’s future results cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected andor have an adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include among other things macroeconomic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation failure to attract new users to the macintosh platform inability to sell thirdparty hardware and software products at adequate margins failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of applebranded and thirdparty retail inventory and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the company’s strategic direction and product roadmap such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management’s attention away from normal business operations insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence process because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results or financial condition 

declines in the sales of the company’s professional products software accessories or service and support contracts or increases in sales of consumer products including ipods may negatively impact the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages 

the company’s professional products including power macintosh and powerbook systems software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than the company’s consumer products including imacs ibooks ipods and content from the itunes music store a shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the company’s future gross margin and operating margin percentages the company’s traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products specifically the imac g5 and ibook instead of professional products professional users may choose to buy the imac g5 due to its relative price performance use of the same powerpc g5 processor used in the company’s power macs and unique design featuring a flat panel screen potential powerbook customers may also choose to purchase ibooks instead due to their price performance and screen size additionally significant future growth in ipod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages 

it is likely that some of the company’s current and potential professional creative and small business customers who are most likely to utilize professional systems believe that the relatively slower mhz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the company utilizes in its macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance these factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the company’s professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 

the company’s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company’s direct sales primarily through its retail and online stores generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales additionally the company’s direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products which generally have higher gross margins than its indirect channels as a result the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix or new product announcements including the transition to intelbased macintosh computers in addition the company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months a pattern typical in the personal computer industry this sales pattern can produce pressure on the company’s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the company’s ability to predict its financial results accurately developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s key logistics components suppliers or manufacturing partners can have significant adverse impacts on the company and its results of operations and financial condition 

the company has higher research and development and selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors 

the company’s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace as a result the company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures further as a result of the expansion of the company’s retail segment and costs associated with marketing the company’s brand including its unique operating system the company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company also has unsecured nontrade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has entered into longterm supply agreements to secure supply of nand flashmemory and intends to prepay a total of 125 billion under these agreements while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses additionally if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate it becomes more likely that the company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors 

the company’s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 

much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including its chief executive officer members of its executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where the majority of 

the company’s key employees are located the company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the company’s future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 

the company is subject to risks associated with the selection availability and cost of insurance 

the company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs higher policy deductibles lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions for some risks because of cost andor availability the company does not have insurance coverage because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks and in some cases self insures completely unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position 

failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the company relies could adversely affect the company’s future operating results 

information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the company’s ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders impeding the manufacture or shipment of products or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures however there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the company or a thirdparty vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

a large portion of the company’s revenue is derived from its international operations as a result the company’s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to nondollar denominated sales in europe japan australia canada and certain parts of asia and nondollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world weaknesses in foreign currencies particularly the japanese yen and the euro can adversely impact consumer demand for the company’s products and the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales conversely a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the company’s foreign denominated sales and in some cases may also increase the cost to the company of some product components 

margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties 

derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

further information related to the company’s global market risks may be found in part ii item 7a of this form 10k under the subheading “foreign currency risk” and may be found in part ii item 8 of this form 10k at notes 1 and 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations 

production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various european union member countries japan and certain states within the us in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

changes in accounting rules could affect the company’s future operating results 

financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies including the fasb and the sec who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards a change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the company’s results of operations in december 2004 the fasb issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for sharebased payments sfas no 123r in april 2005 the sec deferred the effective date of sfas no 123r to years beginning after june 15 2005 therefore sfas no 123r will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company expects the adoption of sfas no 123r will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately 003 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 although the effect from the adoption of sfas no 123r is expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fairvalue of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stockbased compensation expense 

changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results 

the company’s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse affect on the company’s net income and financial condition 

the company’s stock price may be volatile 

the company’s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors including lack of positive general economic and political conditions and investors’ concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets may materially adversely affect the market price of the company’s stock in the future in addition increases in the company’s stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share
